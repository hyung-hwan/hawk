%%%                        The size of the original cacm.bib file
%%%                        covering 1958--1996 became too large (about
%%%                        4000 entries) for BibTeX and TeX to handle,
%%%                        so at version 1.44, it was split into
%%%                        cacm1950.bib, cacm1960.bib, cacm1970.bib,
%%%                        cacm1980.bib, and cacm1990.bib, each covering
%%%                        the decade starting with the year embedded in
%%%                        the filename.  Version numbers for these
%%%                        files begin at 2.00.
%%%
%%%                        Volumes from the 1990s average more than 200
%%%                        articles yearly, so a complete bibliography
%%%                        for this journal could contain more than 6000
%%%                        entries from 1958 to 2000.
%%%
%%%                        These bibliographies also include ACM
%%%                        Algorithms 1--492.  For Algorithms 493--686,
%%%                        including Algorithm 568, published in ACM
%%%                        Transactions on Programming Languages and
%%%                        Systems (TOPLAS), see the companion
%%%                        bibliographies, toms.bib and toplas.bib.
%%%
%%%                        All published Remarks and Corrigenda are
%%%                        cross-referenced in both directions, so
%%%                        that citing a paper will automatically
%%%                        generate citations for those Remarks and
%%%                        Corrigenda.  Cross-referenced entries are
%%%                        duplicated in cacm19*.bib and toms.bib, so
%%%                        that each is completely self-contained.
%%%
%%%                        Source code for ACM Algorithms from 380

The ordered sequence of contour points and the connection graph of the image are first obtained by a modified Ledley algorithm in one image scan. A minimal perimeter polygon subjected to specified constraints is then chosen as the approximating contour. The determination of the minimal polygon can be reduced to a nonlinear programming problem, solved by an algorithm which takes into account the weak bonds between variables. Some examples are presented, and the corresponding computing times are listed.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;Input limited transduction expressions, or translation equations, are used to describe the syntax and left-context sensitive semantics for context-free languages. A formal procedure is given for deriving from a set of translation equations the specifications for a pushdown translator. The translator consists of Mealy form finite-state automata interacting by means of a pushdown stack. Within the framework described string recognition and parsing may be treated as special cases of the translation problem.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;A parsing algorithm which seems to be the most efficient general context-free algorithm known is described. It is similar to both Knuth's LR(k) algorithm and the familiar top-down algorithm. It has a time bound proportional to $n^3$ (where $n$ is the length of the string being parsed) in general; it has a $n^2$ bound for unambiguous grammars; and it runs in linear time on a large class of grammars, which seems to include most practical context-free programming language grammars. In an empirical comparison it appears to be superior to the top-down and bottom-up algorithms studied by Griffiths and Petrick.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;Several specialized techniques are shown for efficiently incorporating spelling correction algorithms in to compilers and operating systems. These include the use of syntax and semantics information, the organization of restricted keyword and symbol tables, and the consideration of a limited class of spelling errors. Sample 360 coding for performing spelling correction is presented. By using systems which perform spelling correction, the number of debugging runs per program has been decreased, saving both programmer and machine time.&quot;,

To the student, TEACH offers loosely guided experience with a conversational language which was designed with teaching in mind. Faculty involvement is limited. At the heart of the TEACH system is an interactive language which somewhat resembles Joss, but is somewhat more amenable to rational explanation. Surrounding the language processor is a teaching system which presents lessons to the student, supervises his progress, and permits him to exercise his skills. A term of experience with TEACH is discussed. Pedagogically, the system appears to be successful; straightforward reimplementation will make it economically successful as well.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;The M \&amp; N procedure is an improvement to the mini-max backing-up procedure widely used in computer programs for game-playing and other purposes. It is based on the principle that it is desirable to have many options when making decisions in the face of uncertainty. The mini-max procedure assigns to a MAX (MIN) node the value of the highest (lowest) valued successor to that node. The M \&amp; N procedure assigns to a MAX (MIN) node some function of the M (N) highest (lowest) valued successors. An M \&amp; N procedure was written in LISP to play the game of kalah, and it was demonstrated that the M \&amp; Nprocedure is significantly superior to the mini-max procedure. The statistical significance of important conclusions is given. Since information on statistical significance has often been lacking in papers on computer experiments in the artificial intelligence field, these experiments can perhaps serve as a model for future work.&quot;,

Although the results are certainly not installation independent, and although they are particularly influenced by features of the B5500 ALGOL system, they should be relevant to the design of new computer systems, especially with respect to the organization of paging schemes.&quot;,

Behavior near the singularity was found to be the dominant factor, and a new estimate, based on a constant curvature assumption and parametric differences, was considered slightly better than the other choices considered.&quot;,

The system is written in LISP 1. 5 and operates on the Q-32 time-sharing system. The system's data structures and their semantic organization, the deductive question-answering formalism of relational properties and complex-relation-forming operators, and the question-answering procedures which employ these features in their operation are all described and illustrated. Examples of the system's performance and of the limitations of its question-answering capability are presented and discussed. It is shown that the use of semantic information in deductive question answering greatly facilitates the process, and that a top-down procedure which works from question to answer enables effective use to be made of this information.&quot;,

This Partial Differential Equation Language, PDEL, is outlined, and the highlights of the translator are briefly summarized. PDEL can handle a large variety of fields. Time-dependent and time-independent fields can be defined. Any size of grid can be used to approximate regular and irregular geometries. Linear, nonlinear, uniform and nonuniform fields can be treated.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;The language PL360, together with its phrase structure grammar, is used as a concrete basis for illustrating an idea called syntax-directed documentation. This idea is-to use the phrase structure of a program to define the structure of a formal documentation for that program; to use the syntactic types and identifiers in the resulting structure to trigger the automatic formation of questions to the programmer, whose answers will become part of that documentation; and to provide automatic storage and retrieval facilities so that other programmers who want to understand or modify the index in various ways by syntactic types and objects. A small PL360 program, already found in the literature, is worked out as an example.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;A matrix calculus is introduced with the intention of developing data structures suitable for a high level algorithmic language for mathematical programming. It is shown how the special structure of matrices can be described and utilized for efficient computing by saving memory space and superfluous operations. Sequences of matrices (and sequences of sequences of matrices) are considered, and matrix operators are extended to sequence operators and cumulative operators. Algorithms are given which use symbol manipulation of matrix expressions so as to find the forms best suited for computation. These forms are called normalforms. Several completeness results are obtained in the sense that for each expression an equivalent expression in normal form can be found within a specified calculus.&quot;,

Picture structuring is considered as the vehicle for man-machine communication. A prototype data format for pictures, called a picture-form, is developed. Structure operators are defined which manipulate picture-forms to produce new picture-forms. Many of the ideas are taken from the symbolic mathematical laboratory at MIT conceived by M.

The elements of such structures are usually restricted to be scalars For many sophisticated applications this restriction can impose cumbersome data representations. An efficient system has been devised and implemented which allows the elements of multidimensional arrays to themselves be multidimensional arrays. This system was developed from a storage structure in which the location, length, and content of each array is described by a codeword which can be interpreted by the system. Codewords may describe arrays containing more codewords, thus providing all needed descriptive information for hyperstructures of any form.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;Four different sequential sampling procedures are applied to the analysis of data generated by a computer simulation experiment with a multi-item inventory model. For each procedure the cost of computer time required to achieve given levels of statistical precision is calculated. Also the cost of computer time using comparable fixed sample size methods is calculated. The computer costs of fixed sample size procedures vs sequential sampling procedures are compared. Details are given for the inventory model and sampling procedures.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;An algorithm is described which accepts an arbitrary context-free grammar and constructs a bounded-context parser for it whenever such a parser exists. The definition of a context-free grammar and the working of a bounded-context parser are recalled. The notion of reduction class for a context-free grammar is then introduced and its connection with the structure of a bounded-context parser is indicated. Next, pushdown automata which generate the different reduction classes of a context-free grammar are defined. Finally, the algorithm is described; it essentially carries out an exhaustive study of all possible runs of the pushdown automata generating the reduction classes. The utility of the algorithm is discussed in the light of the experience gained from its use in compiler design.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;In this experimental programming language, any value which is permitted in some context of the language is permissible in any other meaningful context. In particular, functions and labels are permissible results of functions and values of variables. Assignment and indirect addressing are formalized by introducing values, called references, which in turn possess other values. The assignment operation always affects the relation between some reference and its values. All composed data structures are treated as functions. Type declarations are not permitted. Any data structure may be implicit; i.e., it may be specified by giving an arbitrary algorithm for computing or accessing its components. The existence of label variables permits the construction of coroutines, quasi-parallel processes, and other unorthodox control mechanisms. A variety of programming examples illustrates the generality of the language. Limitations and possible extensions are discussed briefly.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;The use of execution time diagnostics in pinpointing ambiguities in decision tables is discussed. It is pointed out that any attempt at resolving ambiguities at compile time will, in general, be impossible. It is shown that, as a consequence, three methods of converting decision tables to programs are inadequate in regard to ambiguity detection. Two algorithms for programming decision tables whose merits are simplicity of implementation and detection of ambiguities at execution time are presented. The first algorithm is for limited entry decision tables and clarifies the importance of proper coding of the information in the decision table. The second algorithm programs a mixed entry decision table directly without going through the intermediate step of conversion to a limited entry form, thereby resulting in storage economy. A comparison of the algorithms and others proposed in the literature is made. Some features of a decision table to FORTRAN IV translator developed for the IBM 7044 are given.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;The QR iteration for the eigenvalues of a symmetric tridiagonal matrix can be accelerated by incorporating a sequence of origin shifts. The origin shift may be either subtracted directly from the diagonal elements of the matrix or incorporated by means of an implicit algorithm. Both methods have drawbacks-the direct method can unnecessarily degrade small eigenvalues, while the implicit method can effectively loose the shift and thereby retard the convergence. A new method which has neither drawback is presented. Both the algorithm proposed here and the implicit algorithm are safer than the explicit algorithm. The implicit algorithm requires somewhat less computation, but the new algorithm will give faster convergence in some cases, an important consideration when eigenvectors are being calculated.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;Future users of large data banks must be protected from having to know how the data is organized in the machine (the internal representation). A prompting service which supplies such information is not a satisfactory solution. Activities of users at terminals and most application programs would remain unaffected when the internal representation of data is changed and even when some aspects of the external representation are changed. Changes in data representation will often be needed as a result of changes in query, update, and report traffic and natural growth in the types of stored information. Existing noninferential, formatted data systems provide users with tree-structured files or slightly more general network models of the data. In Section 1, inadequacies of these models are discussed. A model based on $n$-ary relations, a normal form for data base relations, and the concept of a universal data sublanguage are introduced. In Section 2, certain operations on relations (other than logical inference) are discussed and applied to the problems of redundancy and consistency in the user's model.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;LAP6 is an on-line system running on 2048- word LINC which provides full facilities for text editing, automatic filing and file maintenance, and program preparation and assembly. It focuses on the preparation and editing of continuously displayed 23,040- character text strings (manuscripts) which can be positioned anywhere by the user and edited by simply adding and deleting lines as though working directly on an elastic scroll. Other features are available through a uniform command set which itself can be augmented by the user. The machine, although small, aids program design by providing display scope and premarked randomly addressable LINC tapes as standard items, in an environment similar to that of a sophisticated terminal. The tapes are logically similar to a disk. Priority was given to the design of efficient tape algorithms to minimize the limitations of the small memory. Techniques developed for handling scroll editing, filing, and the layered system structure are outlined.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;Trade-offs among certain computational factors in hash coding are analyzed. The paradigm problem considered is that of testing a series of messages one-by-one for membership in a given set of messages. Two new hash-coding methods are examined and compared with a particular conventional hash-coding method. The computational factors considered are the size of the hash area (space), the time required to identify a message as a nonmember of the given set (reject time), and an allowable error frequency. The new methods are intended to reduce the amount of space required to contain the hash-coded information from that associated with conventional methods. The reduction in space is accomplished by exploiting the possibility that a small fraction of errors of commission may be tolerable in some applications, in particular, applications in which a large amount of data is involved and a core resident hash area is consequently not feasible using conventional methods. An example is discussed which illustrates possible areas of application for the new method.&quot;,

The amount of memory required by the algorithm is essentially no more than the required to store a single complete derivation. In addition, a modified version of the basic algorithm is presented which blocks infinite analyses for grammars which contain loops. The algorithm is also compared with several previous parsers for context-sensitive grammars and general rewriting systems, and the difference between the two types of analyses is discussed. The algorithm appears to be complementary to an algorithm by S. Kuno in several respects, including the space-time trade-off and the degree of context dependence involved.&quot;,

Inasmuch as pricing must serve as a rationing mechanism at times, consideration is given to the means by which prices can be adjusted flexibly in order to make a dynamic allocation of resources. Consideration is given to the means by which users can be insulated from the harmful effects of frequent price fluctuations. Two illustrative pricing systems are discussed in order to demonstrate the applicability of pricing in quite different environments.&quot;,

The simple quadratic search only accesses half the table. It has been shown that when the length of the table is a prime of the form 4n plus 3, where n is an integer, the whole table may be accessed by two quadratic searches plus a separate access for the original entry point. A search method is presented which is computationally simple, has all the advantages of the quadratic search, and yet accesses all the table in one sweep.&quot;,

The study was concerned with the implementation of sorting procedures in the context of the dynamic paging environment characteristic of virtual memory machines. Descriptions of the experimental sort programs and analysis of the performance measurement results obtained for them are presented. The insight gained from the experimental effort is used to arrive at a set of broad guidelines for writing sort programs for a paging environment.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;Characteristics of an interactive software system, intended to constitute an interface between designer and computer during various steps of the design process, are presented. Main emphasis is given to the description of the features of the two high level user oriented languages, operating at different levels, on which the interaction is based. The first one is IMOL, an interactive monitor language, which is designed to perform the overall and control functions of the software system. The second one is COIF, a circuit oriented graphic language, which is designed to describe, generate, and manipulate graphic problem specifications. The application to computer-aided circuit design is in particular examined.&quot;,

A formula is derived expressing $!$ in terms of the probability distribution of the `bound' of a partition. Another generalization of quicksort is presented which uses a bounding interval instead of a single element as bound. This generalization turns out to be easy to implement in a computer program. A numerical approximation shows that $!$ equals 1.140 for this version of quicksort compared with 1.386 for the original. This implies a decrease in number of comparisons of 18\%; actual tests showed about 15\% saving in computing time.&quot;,

The coefficients of the approximation are determined by linear programming so as to minimize the error in either the L1 or L-infinity norm. Auxiliary conditions such as monotonicity or convexity of the approximation can also be imposed. This interactive system is described and several examples of its use are given.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;NEATER2 accepts a PL/I source program and operates on it to produce a reformatted version. When in the LOGICAL mode, NEATER2 indicates the logical structure of the source program in the indentation pattern of its output. Logic errors discovered through NEATER2 logical analysis are discovered much more economically than is possible through compilation and trial runs. A number of options are available to give the user full control over the output format and to maximize the utility of NEATER2 as an aid during the early stages of development of a PL/I source deck. One option, USAGE, causes NEATER2 to insert into each logical unit of coding a statement which will case the number of times each one is executed to be recorded during execution. This feature is expected to provide a major aid in optimization of PL/I programs.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;A theoretically most efficient search algorithm is presented which uses an exhaustive search to find all of the elementary circuits of a graph. The algorithm can be easily modified to find all of the elementary circuits with a particular attribute such as length. A rigorous proof of the algorithm is given as well as an example of its application. Empirical bounds are presented relating the speed of the algorithm to the number of vertices and the number of arcs. The speed is also related to the number of circuits in the graph to give a relation between speed and complexity. Extensions to undirected and s-graphs are discussed.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;A study of multiaccess computer communications has characterized the distributions underlying an elementary model of the user-computer interactive process. The model used is elementary in the sense that many of the random variables that generally are of interest in computer communications studies can be decomposed into the elements of this model. Data were examined from four operational multiaccess systems, and the model is shown to be robust; that is each of the variables of the model has the same distribution independent of which of the four systems is being examined. It is shown that the gamma distribution can be used to describe the discrete variables. Approximations to the gamma distribution by the exponential distribution are discussed for the systems studied.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;Three cyphers allegedly authored by Thomas Jefferson Beale in 1822 have been the subject of intensive study for over 100 years. Generations of cryptanalysts have expended untold man-years, thus far without success, attempting tode code them; vast armies of fortune hunters and treasure seekers have devoted Herculean labors to digging up the rolling hills of Virginia trying to locate the promised bonanza. \par The history of pertinent activities would fill volumes, yet serious students of cryptography have always had nagging doubts about the cyphers' authenticity. It has been alleged that the ``known solution'' to Cypher Number Two: 115, 73, 24, 818, 37, 52, 49, \ldots{} (``I have deposited in the County of Bedford about four miles from Buford's in an excavation or vault \ldots{}'') with the aid of an unsanitized version of the Declaration of Independence was merely a superb, imaginative, and grandiose hoax perpetrated ages ago for whatever reasons. Modern computer technology could obviously perform signature analyses the process of encoding itself so as to yield new clues and deeper insights into their construction. For the benefit of the uninitiated, the encoding method used in the second cypher employs a specified document whose words are simply numbered consecutively, and first letters of these words are sought out at random to match the letters of these words are sought out at random to match the letters of the clear text or message. \par The sequence of numbers corresponding to these matches is then written down as the final code. While primitive, the process has the advantage of relative security until the source document becomes known; at that moment the cypher can be decoded even by second graders. The work now completed with the help of our UNIVAC 1108 includes numerous analytical studies of the Beale cyphers and various types of simulations. \par For example, we have turned the entire process of simulated encoding by various schemes over to the machine and analyzed the signatures of these synthetic codes; we have also encoded various messages by hand, using different texts and a variety of methods to obtain their signatures. These simulations provide convincing evidence that the signatures are both process and data dependent; they indicate also very strongly that Mr. Beale's cyphers are for real and that it is merely a matter of time before someone finds the correct source document and locates the right vault in the common-wealth of Virginia.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;Given the horizontal and vertical projections of a finite binary pattern $f$, can we construct the original pattern $f$? In this paper we give a characterization of patterns that are reconstructible from their projection. Three algorithms are developed to reconstruct both unambiguous and ambiguous patterns. It is shown that an unambiguous pattern can be perfectly reconstructed in time $m \times n$ and that a pattern similar to an ambiguous pattern can also be constructed in time $m \times n$, where $m$, $n$ are the dimensions of the pattern frame.&quot;,

The second modification completely tests the ELSE Rule but results in more executions than the first modification. Both modifications result in lower execution time than Pollack's algorithm. However, neither modification guarantees a globally optimal solution.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;An automatic learning capability has been developed and implemented for use with the MULTIPLE (MULTIpurpose Program that LEarns) heuristic tree-searching program, which is presently being applied to resolution theorem-proving in predicate calculus. MULTIPLE's proving program (PP) uses two evaluation functions to guide its search for a proof of whether or not a particular goal is achievable. Thirteen general features of predicate calculus clauses were created for use in the automatic learning of better evaluation functions for PP. A multiple regression program was used to produce optimal coefficients for linear polynomial functions in terms of the features.\par Also, automatic data-handling routines were written for passing data between the learning program and the proving program, and for analyzing and summarizing results. Data was generally collected for learning (regression analysis) from the experience of PP. A number of experiments were performed to test the effectiveness and generality of the learning program. Results showed that the learning produced dramatic improvements in the solutions to problems which were in the same domain as those used for collection learning data. Learning was also shown to generalize successfully to domains other than those used for data collection. Another experiment demonstrated that the learning program could simultaneously improve performance on problems in a specific domain and on problems in a variety of domains. Some variations of the learning program were also tested.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;\ldots{}unction for binary tree values, the values reflecting sorting effort. The analysis does not assume uniformly distributed branching ratios, and therefore is applicable to a family of sorting algorithms discussed by Hoare, Singleton, and van Emden. \par The solution to the integral equation indicates that using more advanced algorithms in the family makes only minor reductions in the expected sorting effort, but substantially reduces the variance in sorting effort. Statistical tests of the values of several thousand trees containing up to 10,000 points have given first, second, and third moments of the value distribution function in satisfactory agreement with the moments computed from the generating function. The empirical tests, as well as the analytical results, are in agreement with previously published results for the first moment in the cases of uniform and nonuniform distribution of branching ratio, and for the second moment in the case of uniform distribution of branching ratio.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;A sequential pattern recognition (SPR) procedure does not test all the features of a pattern at once. Instead, it selects a feature to be tested. After receiving the result of that test, the procedure either classifies the unknown pattern or selects another feature to be tested, etc. Medical diagnosis is an example of SPR. In this paper the authors suggest that SPR be viewed as a one-person game played against nature (chance). Virtually all the powerful techniques developed for searching two-person, strictly competitive game trees can easily be incorporated either directly or by analogy into SPR procedures. \par In particular, one can incorporate the ``mini average backing-up procedure'' and the ``gamma procedure,'' which are the analogues of the ``minimax backing-up procedure'' and the ``alpha-beta procedure,'' respectively. \par Some computer simulated experiments in character recognition are presented. The results indicate that the approach is promising.&quot;,

The method is illustrated by the automatic construction of both recursive and iterative programs operating on natural numbers,lists, and trees, In order to construct a program satisfying certain specifications a theorem induced by those specifications is proved, and the desired program is extracted from the proof. The same technique is applied to transform recursively defined functions into iterative programs, frequently with a major gain inefficiency. It is emphasized that in order to construct a program with loops or with recursion, the principle of mathematical induction must be applied. The relation between the version of the induction rule used and the form of the program constructed is explored in some detail.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;The utilization of storage is studied in a two-level memory hierarchy. The first storage level, which is the fast store, is divided into a number of storage areas. When an entry is to be filed in the hierarchy, a hashing algorithm will attempt to place the entry into one of these areas. If this particular area is full, then the entry will be placed into the slower second-level store, even though other areas in the first-level store may have space available. Given that N entries have been filed in the entire hierarchy, an expression is derived for the expected number of entries filed in the first-level store. This expression gives a measure of how effectively the first-level store is being used. By means of examples, storage utilization is then studied as a function of the hashing algorithm, the number of storage areas into which the first-level store is divided and the total size of the first-level store.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;The division algorithm theorem is expressed in a form that permits it to serve as the basis for devising division operations that produce both quotient and remainder in complement form. Algorithms for division yielding complement results are derived for numbers represented in any base greater than one. Both radix and radix-less-one complementation schemes are considered. The binary form of the algorithms thus includes both two's and one's complement implementation. The problem of quotient overflow for complement results is dealt with as is that of selecting an appropriate form of the remainder condition for complement division.&quot;,

This technique takes advantage of both the computer's and the human's problem-solving abilities. The computer is not asked to solve the problem in a brute force way as in many of today's heuristics, but it is asked to organize the data for the human so that the human can solve the problem easily. The technique used in this paper seems to point to new directions in the field of man-machine interaction and in the field of artificial intelligence.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;Systematic generation of a specific class of permutations fundamental to scheduling problems is described. In a nonoriented complete graph with n vertices, Hamiltonian circuits equivalent to $.5(n - 1)!$ specific permutations of $n$ elements, termed rosary permutations, can be defined. Each of them corresponds to two circular permutations which mirror-image each other, and is generated successively by a number system covering $3*4*\ldots*(n-1)$ sets of edges. Every set of edges $\{E[k]\}, 1 &lt;= E[k] &lt;= k, 3 &lt;= k &lt;= (n-1)$ is determined recursively by constructing a Hamiltonian circuit with $k$ vertices from a Hamiltonian circuit with $k-1$ vertices, starting with the Hamiltonian circuit of 3 vertices. The basic operation consists of transposition of a pair of adjacent vertices where the position of the pair in the permutation is determined by $\{E[k]\}$. Two algorithms treating the same example for five vertices are presented. It is very easy to derive all possible n! permutations from the $.5(n - 1 )!$ rosary permutations be cycling the permutations and by taking them in the reverse order-procedures which can be performed fairly efficiently by computer.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;In this paper the Ritz-Trefftz algorithm is applied to the computer solution of the state regulator problem. The algorithm represents a modification of the Ritz direct method and is designed to improve the speed of solution and the storage requirements to the point where real-time implementation becomes feasible. The modification is shown to be more stable computationally than the traditional Ritz approach. \par The first concern of the paper is to describe the algorithm and establish its properties as a valid and useful numerical technique. In particular such useful properties as definiteness and reasonableness of condition are established for the method. The second part of the paper is devoted to a comparison of the new techniques with the standard procedure of numerically integrating a matrix Riccati equation to determine a feedback matrix. The new technique is shown to be significantly faster for comparable accuracy.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;An efficient method is presented for finding blocks and cutnodes of an arbitrary undirected graph. The graph may be represented either (i) as an ordered list of edges or (ii) as a packed adjacency matrix. If $w$ denotes the word length of the machine employed, the storage (in machine words) required for a graph with $n$ nodes and $m$ edges increases essentially as $2(m+n)$ in case (i), or $(n^2)/w$ in case (ii). A spanning tree with labeled edges is grown, two edges finally bearing different labels if and only if they belong to different blocks. For both representations the time required to analyze a graph on $n$ nodes increases as $n^G$ where $G$ depends on the type of graph, $1 &lt;= G &lt;= 2$, and both bounds are attained. \par Values of G are derived for each of several suitable families of test graphs, generated by an extension of the web grammar approach. The algorithm is compared in detail with that proposed by Read for which 1 &lt;= G &lt;= 3.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;A fixed buffer allocation for merge-sorting is presented here which minimizes the number of input-output operations for a given order of merge. \par When sorting on movable arm disks, the number of seeks is equal to the number of input-output operations, and the seek time usually controls the sort time. First some standard terminology is introduced. Then the input buffer allocation method is described, followed by an analysis of the improvement to be expected over more conventional allocation. This analysis makes use of a particular distribution function. An analysis of a completely different distribution is given which yields similar results. This suggests that the results do not depend on a particular distribution function. An optimum output buffer size is also determined. It is concluded that this buffering allocation can significantly reduce the time of merge sorting on movable arm disks when the input data are not random, and that this output buffer allocation should be used whether the data is random or not.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;An arithmetic expression can often be broken down into its component subexpressions. Depending on the hardware environment in which the expression is to be executed, these subexpressions can be evaluated in serials, in parallel, or in a combination of these modes. This paper shows that expression execution time can be minimized only if consideration is given to the ordering of the subexpressions. In particular, subexpressions should be executed in order of decreasing memory and processor time requirements. This observation is valid for configurations ranging from a uniprocessor with an unbuffered main memory to multiprocessor with a ``cache'' buffer memory. If the number of subexpressions which can be executed in parallel exceeds the number of available processors, then execution of some of these subexpressions must be postponed. A procedure is given which combines this requirement with the earlier ordering considerations to provide an optimal execution sequence.&quot;,

The third, from mathematics, led to Richardson's proof of the unsolvability of the problem for a class of functions and for Risch's decision procedure for the elementary functions.Generalizations of Risch's algorithm to a class of special functions and programs for solving differential equations and for finding the definite integral are also described.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;Various dispersion algorithms for the polyphase sorting procedure are examined.The optimum algorithm based on minimizing the total number of unit strings read is displayed. The logic of this algorithm is rather complicated; hence, several other new dispersion algorithms with more straightforward logic are presented. Of the simple dispersion algorithms discussed, the Horizontal is best. It does approximately one-fourth to one and one-half percent less reading and writing than most algorithms in use today. An additional two and one-fourth to three percent improvement can be achieved by utilizing the Modified Optimum Algorithm. This algorithm is relatively straightforward, but it requires a fairly close estimate of the total number of unit strings before the dispersion begins.&quot;,

Usually, in such situations, the picture is far from determined and the problem is to find the ``most representative'' picture. Three algorithms are described (all using Monte Carlo methods) which were designed to solve this problem. The algorithms are applicable in a large and varied number of fields. The most important uses may be the reconstruction of possibly asymmetric particles from electron micrographs and three-dimensional X-ray analysis.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;The best of a dozen different methods for compressing map data is illustrated. The choices are generated by encoding data strings-sequence of like codes-by three methods and in four directions. Relationships are developed between compression alternatives to avoid comparing all of them. The technique has been used to compress data from forest resource maps, but is widely applicable to map and photographic data reduction.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;A language, BLISS, is described. This language is designed so as to be especially suitable for use in writing production software systems for a specific machine (the PDP-10): compilers, operating systems, etc. Prime design goals of the design are the ability to produce highly efficient object code, to allow access to all relevant hardware features of the host machine, and to provide a rational means by which to cope with the evolutionary nature of systems programs. A major feature which contributes to the realization of these goals is a mechanism permitting the definition of the representation of all data structures in terms of the access algorithm for elements of the structure.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;A parallel processing algorithm for shrinking binary patterns to obtain single isolated elements, one for each pattern, is presented. This procedure may be used for counting patterns on a matrix, and a hardware implementation of the algorithm using large scale integrated technology is envisioned. The principal features of this method are the very small window employed (two-by-two elements), the parallel nature of the process, and the possibility of shrinking any pattern, regardless of the complexity of its configuration. Problems regarding merging and disconnection of patterns during the process as well as the determination of the maximum number of steps necessary to obtain a single isolated element from a pattern, are reviewed and discussed. An analogy with a neural network description, in terms of McCulloch-Pitts ``neurons'' is presented.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;Hough has proposed an interesting and computationally efficient procedure for detecting lines in pictures. This paper points out that the use of angle-radius rather than slope-intercept parameters simplifies the computation further. It also shows how the method can be used for more general curve fitting, and gives alternative interpretations that explain the source of its efficiency.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;Because of the problems created by the explosion of papers in the mathematical sciences and the drawbacks that this places on research, it is suggested that a tree of all mathematical results and terminology be maintained in a multiterminal computer system.\par Users of the system can store in the computer an updated file of their current knowledge, and on selecting a paper to read, they can obtain from the computer the minimum subtree of theorems required to bring them from what they already know to the background knowledge which the paper assumes. Under certain conditions, means are also provided for the contribution of useful comments by the readers of a work and for interaction between commentators and with the author. \par This paper describes how the system can be organized and the role required of readers, writers, and commentators.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;A program's working set $W(t,T)$ at time $t$ is the set of distinct pages among the T most recently referenced pages. Relations between the average working-set size, the missing-page rate, and the interreference-interval distribution may be derived both from time-average definitions and from ensemble-average (statistical) definitions. An efficient algorithm for estimating these quantities is given. The relation to LRU (least recently used) paging is characterized. The independent-reference model, in which page references are statistically independent, is used to assess the effects to interpage dependencies on working-set size observations. Under general assumptions, working-set size is shown to be normally distributed.&quot;,

This paper describes a polygon comparison scheme in which the relationships of two polygons can be classified into tree types, and also discusses how the relationship is changed for each pair of polygons under rotation about some axis. A rotation table is defined for each pair of polygons, which remains fixed as long as rotation is about one axis and provides a means of rapidly determining the visible and hidden line relationship between two polygons. \par Additional work must be done to extend this approach to simultaneous rotation about several axes.&quot;,

The impact of computers is divided into five components: political, economic, cultural, social, and moral; the main part of the paper defines each component and presents examples of the relevant issues. In the remaining portions the possible formats for such a course are discussed, a topic by topic outline is given, and a selected set of references is listed. It is hoped that the proposal will make it easier to initiate courses on this subject.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;Clenshaw-Curtis quadrature is a particularly important automatic quadrature scheme for a variety of reasons, especially the high accuracy obtained from relatively few integrand values. However, it has received little use because it requires the computation of a cosine transformation and the arithmetic cost of this has been prohibitive. This paper is in two parts; a companion paper, ``II Computing the Cosine Transformation,'' shows that this objection can be overcome by computing the cosine transformation by a modification of the fast Fourier transform algorithm. \par This first part discusses the strategy and various error estimates, and summarizes experience with a particular implementation of the scheme.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;In a companion paper to this, ``I Methodology and Experiences,'' the automatic Clenshaw-Curtis quadrature scheme was described and how each quadrature formula used in the scheme requires a cosine transformation of the integrand values was shown. The high cost of these cosine transformations has been a serious drawback in using Clenshaw-Curtis quadrature. \par Two other problems related to the cosine transformation have also been trouble some. First, the conventional computation of the cosine transformation by recurrence relation is numerically unstable, particularly at the low frequencies which have the largest effect upon the integral. Second, in case the automatic scheme should require refinement of the sampling, storage is required to save the integrand values after the cosine transformation is computed. This second part of the paper shows how the cosine transformation can be computed by a modification of the fast Fourier transform and all three problems overcome. The modification is also applicable in other circumstances requiring cosine or sine transformations, such as polynomial interpolation through the Chebyshev points.&quot;,

  annote =       &quot;This paper presents a proposal for structured representation of multiprogramming in a high level language. Shared variables are introduced, and their role in `critical regions (denoted by the structured statement region var do Statement') is discussed. A synchronization primitive `await Boolean' delays a process until the components of a shared variable satisfy the boolean expression. For explicit control of the scheduling of resources, an event queue is associated with a shared variable, and two procedures await (event) (leave a critical region associated with the shared variable and join the event queue) and cause (event) (enable all processes in the event queue to reenter their critical regions) are provided, which can control process scheduling to any degree desired.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;In spite of impressive gains by PL/I, Fortran and Cobol remain the languages in which most of the world's production programs are written and will remain so into the foreseeable future. There is a great deal of theoretical interest in Algol 68 and in extensible languages, but so far at least they have had little practical impact. Problem-oriented languages may very well become the most important language development area in the next five to ten years.\par In the operating system area all major computer manufacturers set out to produce very ambitious multiprogramming systems, and they all ran into similar problems. A number of university projects,though not directly comparable to those of the manufacturers, have contributed greatly to a better understanding of operating system principles. Important trends include the increased interest in the development of system measurement and evaluation techniques,and increased use of microprogramming for some programming system functions.&quot;,

A key part of the paper is a tree showing the chronological development of languages and their interrelationships. Reasons for the proliferation of languages are given. The major languages are listed with the reasons for their importance. A section on chronology indicates the happenings of the significant previous time periods and the major topics of 1972. Key concepts other than specific languages are discussed.&quot;,

This paper presents a bottom-up scheme for parsing them, based on an extension of Floyd Production Language (FPL). Included is an algorithm, similar to that of DeRemer's, for covering a large class of affix grammars into FPL. The paper discusses the applicabilities of the conversion algorithm and affix grammars in general, and some possible extensions to Koster's definition of affix grammars.&quot;,

These changes in memory configuration are represented explicitly in the model, CPU requirements and page exception characteristics of program material being described statistically. Expressions for the distribution of the number of page-frames allocated to an executing program, the long run expected fraction of a program's execution time in a given number of page-frames, and the average execution interval of the multiprogrammed load are obtained. It is pointed out heuristically and demonstrated numerically that an increase is obtainable in the average execution interval of the multiprogrammed load over that resulting from equal fixed partitioning of main memory.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;Several parallelized algorithms are presented for the solution of certain spanning tree, distance, and path problems, with direct applications to wire routing, PERT chart analysis, and the analysis of many types of networks. These algorithms exhibit a computation time that in many cases grows at a rate not exceeding log//2 n, where n is the number of nodes in the graph. Straightforward cellular implementations of the well-known serial algorithms for these problems require about n steps, and noncellular implementations require from n**2 to n**3 steps.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;The structure of a general contour map is analyzed, and its topological properties are utilized in developing a new scanning algorithm. The problem of detection and recognition of contour lines is solved by a two color labeling method. It is shown that for maps containing normal contour lines only, it suffices to distinguish between so-called ``even'' and ``odd'' lines. The ``tangency problem'' involved in practical scanning is discussed, and a solution base on minimizing computer memory space and simplifying control program is suggested.&quot;,

Pictorial results produced by each of the algorithms are presented and the relative performances of the algorithms are compared. It is found that the algorithm operating with the triangular array is the most sensitive to image irregularities and noise, yet it will yield a thinned image with an overall reduced number of points. It is concluded that the algorithm operating in conjunction with the hexagonal array has features which strike a balance between those of the other two arrays.&quot;,

A number of procedures convert Taylor series expansions directly into sampling steps, an approach which may be used for sampling from any continuous distribution. For the exponential distribution a definite recommendation can be made, whereas in the case of the normal distribution there remains a choice between slower and shorter algorithms and faster but space consuming methods.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;The inversion of a particular integral equation of the first (Fredholm) kind is the basic problem considered. The strategy which yielded success consisted of three essential points: (1) fit the known experimental data by a curve with properties which derive from properties of the (as yet unknown) function; (2) stabilize the computation for the unknown function by using singular value decomposition; (3) constrain the unknown function approximation (since it represents a probability distribution) to be nonnegative. \par A number of test cases are presented. One set of actual experimental data is analyzed with the procedures presented.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;A system is described for generating English sentences from a form of semantic nets in which the nodes are word-sense meanings and the paths are primarily deep case relations. The grammar used by the system is in the form of a network that imposes an ordering on a set of syntactic transformations that are expressed as LISP functions. The generation algorithm uses the information in the semantic network to select appropriate generation paths through the grammar. The system is designed for use as a computational tool that allows a linguist to develop and study methods for generating surface strings from an underlying semantic structure. Initial findings with regard to form determiners such as voice, form, tense, and mood, some rules for embedding sentences, and some attention to pronominal substitution are reported. The system is programmed in LISP 1.5 and is available from the authors.&quot;,

The algorithms are based on the rule mask method but need not have the masks at execution time. They perform the logical operations immediately rather than at the end of the interpreting process. Execution time can be considerably reduced by instantly marking rules which are not applicable or conditions which are already tested. The new algorithms combine to a certain degree the advantages of mask methods with those of tree methods.&quot;,

A program is mapped into an expression within a decidable subset of the lambda-calculus, which characterizes the type relations within the program and eliminates all other information. The determination of the type-wise correctness or incorrectness of the program is resolved by reducing its corresponding lambda-calculus expression to one of two normal forms, the constant ``correct'' for a type-wise correct program or the constant ``error.'' An application to type checking in Algol 60 is made, and the attendant problems faced for any notion of type checking are discussed.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;The classical process of partitioning an array into subarrays is extended to a more useful array language operation. Various modes of partitioning are defined for different types of arrays, so that subarrays may vary over the original array in a nearly arbitrary manner. These definitions are motivated with several realistic examples to illustrate the value of partitioning for array languages. Of general interest is the data structure for partitioning. This consists of dynamic tree structures which are used to derive and maintain the array control information. These are described in sufficient detail to be of value in the design of other array languages. The description presented in this paper is implemented in a new array language, OL/2, currently under development at the University of Illinois.&quot;,

The goal is to automatically generate code for handling the tedious address calculations necessitated by complicated data structures. The paper is therefore preoccupied with ``indexing by position.'' The relationship of ``indexing by name'' and ``indexing by position'' is discussed.&quot;,

The effectiveness of a ``modularization'' is dependent upon the criteria used in dividing the system into modules. A system design problem presented and both a conventional and unconventional decomposition are described. It is shown that the unconventional decompositions have distinct advantages for the goals outlined. The criteria used in arriving at the decompositions are discussed. The unconventional decomposition, if implemented with the conventional assumption that a module consists of one or more subroutines, will be less efficient in most cases. An alternative approach to implementation which does not this effect is sketched.&quot;,

A technique for accomplishing this rescattering is presented. The technique is independent of both the length of the table and the hashing function used, and can be utilized in conjunction with a linear reallocation of the table being rescattered. Moreover, it can be used to eliminate previously flagged deletions from any hash-coded table, or to change from one hashing method to another. The efficiency of the technique is discussed and theoretical statistics are given.&quot;,

Other operations such as log, sin, and cos, which have simple series expansions, can be handled similarly.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;An algorithm is described for reducing a generalized eigenvalue problem to an ordinary problem, in case A and B are symmetric band matrices with B positive definite. If n is the order of the matrix and m the bandwidth, the matrices A and B are partitioned into m-by-m blocks; and the algorithm is described in terms of these blocks. The algorithm reduces the generalized problem to an ordinary eigenvalue problem for a symmetric band matrix C whose bandwidth is the same as A and B. The algorithm is similar to those of Rutishauser and Schwartz for the reduction of symmetric matrices to band form. The calculation of C requires order N**2m operation. The round-off error in the calculation of C is of the same order as the sum of the errors at each of the n/m steps of the algorithm, the latter errors being largely determined by the condition of B with respect to inversion.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;A novel computer-searchable representation for the three basic pictorial features, contour maps, region coverage, and line structures, is described. The representation, which has practical storage requirements, provides a rapid means of searching large files for data associated with geometric position as well as with attribute value. An application of this representation to handling terrain information illustrates its utility. The algebraic properties of the data structure make it computationally easy to determine whether a point lies within a closed boundary; compute the area contained by a closed boundary; generate the closed boundary representing the union or intersection of two closed boundaries; and determine the neighboring boundaries to a point and the minimum distances between them and the point. Pertinent to mapping.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;Both in designing a new programming language and in extending an existing language, the designer is faced with the problem of deriving a ``natural'' grammar for the language. We are proposing an interactive approach to the grammar design problem wherein the designer presents a sample of sentences and structures as input to a grammatical inference algorithm. The algorithm then constructs a grammar which is a reasonable generalization of the examples submitted by the designer. \par The implementation is presently restricted to a subclass of operator precedence grammars, but a second algorithm is outlined which applies to a larger class of context-free grammars.&quot;,

In this paper the reasons for this failure are explored, and a new methodology which overcomes many of the difficulties is proposed. A system which integrates performance evaluation with design and implementation is described. This system is based on a simple, high level language which is used to describe the evolving system at all stages of its development. The source language description is used as direct input to performance analysis and simulation routines. using the performance information obtained from these routines as feedback, the problems which adversely affect performance are detected early enough so that they can be corrected without costly major reimplementation of the proposed system.&quot;,

It describes the synergistic effect that the freedom to move and alter features from one of these domains to another has had on the design of this system (which has not been implemented). This freedom simplified both incremental compilation and the system's addressing structure, and centralized the communication mechanisms enabling the construction of hierarchical subsystems. It also suggested an important new concept for operating systems: separation of the scheduling from the maintenance functions in resource allocation. This separation enables incorporation of new scheduling algorithms (decision of what to do) without endangering the system integration (correctly performing the scheduling decisions).&quot;,

The method relies on hand selection of a set of text strings which are common to one or more messages. These phrases are then stored only once. The storage technique gives rise to a mathematical optimization problem: determine how each message should use the available phrases to minimize its storage requirement. This problem is nontrivial when phrases which overlap exist. However, a dynamic programming algorithm is presented which solves the problem in time which grows linearly with the number of characters in the text. Algorithm 444 applies to this paper.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;A study is made of the way in which asynchronous time division multiplexing changes the stochastic nature of the arrival process from a user to the computer and, consequently, affects the performance of a time-shared computer-communications system. It is concluded that while, for certain values of system parameters, there is noticeable improvement in the performance of the computer (model), in the sense that time-shared scheduling delays are reduced, these improvements are offset by the transmission delays imposed by multiplexing so that there may be little or no change in the computer-communications system performance. Analytical and simulation results are based on the model of the computer-communications system being an M/D/I queue (the multiplexor) in tandem with a single exponential server (the computer). Analytical results include a general description of the output process of an M/D/1 queue and the conditions under which this output process is approximately Poisson.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;PL/C is a compiler for a dialect for PL/I. The design objective was to provide a maximum degree of diagnostic assistance in a batch processing environment. For the most part this assistance is implicit and is provided automatically by the compilers. The most remarkable characteristic of PL/C is its perseverance --- it completes translation of every program submitted and continues execution until a user-established error limit is reached. This requires that the compiler repair errors encountered during both translation and execution, and the design of PL/C is dominated by this consideration. PL/C also introduces several explicit user-controlled facilities for program testing. To accommodate these extensions to PL/I without abandoning compatibility with the IBM compiler, PL/C permits ``pseudo comments'' --- constructions whose contents can optionally be considered either source text or comment. In spite of the diagnostic effort PL/C is a fast and efficient processor. It effectively demonstrates that compilers can provide better diagnostic assistance than is customarily offered, even when a sophisticated source language is employed, and that this assistance need not be prohibitively costly.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;A study is presented of some of the system implications of memory hierarchies in which the backing or secondary store has a very small read time, relative of both the time required for writing and to the read time of conventional backing storage devices. Several analytic models are introduced, and it is shown that such hierarchies may operate in ways which differ from those of more conventional hierarchies. In particular, it is shown that it may not be necessary to multiprogram in such a situation. \par In the past, backing storage devices have been roughly symmetric with respect to their read and write times. This situation may not continue, as several devices are currently under development which may have a very small read-time/write-time ratio. This study places particular emphasis on one such system-the RCA read/write holographic optical memory.&quot;,

The arithmetic systems studied are 6-digit hexadecimal and 22-digit binary floating point number representations combined with the usual chop and round modes of arithmetic with various numbers of guard digits, and with a modified round mode with guard digits. In a certain sense, arithmetic systems differing only in their use of binary or hexadecimal number representations are shown to be approximately statistically equivalent in accuracy. Further, the usual round mode with guard digits is shown to be statistically superior in accuracy to the usual chop mode in all cases save one. The modified round mode is found to be superior to the chop mode in all cases.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;The behavior of a computer system is largely dependent upon the algorithm employed to allocate the system resources to the processes competing for them. Recent research in time-sharing paging systems has developed the working set model for program behavior, and a resource allocation strategy based on this model has been proposed. Two implementations along these principles have been reported, but it seems that in neither case have further results been announced. This report discusses the design and implementation of a dispatcher based on the working set principle, presents data to permit analysis of its behavior, and indicates future directions of research on methods of controlling a computer system.&quot;,

The problem is analyzed in terms of psychological and information-processing processes, and what turns out to be a vicious circle of effects is described. The paper then considers how the presentation of information by a computer-based information retrieval system, or by other media, can be improved. Some trade-offs which affect the design of the presentation are mentioned, and a number of ideas for improvement are described. These include ways of augmenting written language by various notational and linguistic devices, the exhibition of the structure inherent in the information the authors are communicating, and a sophisticated interactive system controlled by computer.&quot;,

A system might, for example, consist of fast semiconductor memory, computer core memory, extended core storage, disk memory, and data cells. Equations are derived to predict the effect of such a system on data access times using sequential files, random access files, and structured files employing multiple-hierarchical linked lists.&quot;,

A minimal even-node network is an event-node network in which both the number of nodes and the number of arcs are the minima to preserve the given precedence relations. Counterexamples are given to show that the algorithm presented by A. C. Fisher, J. S. Liebman, and G. L. Nemhauser (1968) produces event-node networks which are not minimal. Since our procedure includes the set-covering problem, the time required may grow exponentially with the number of given activities.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;Resource scheduling and allocation can be expensive with regard to time and space in multiprogramming or time-sharing environments involving large numbers of tasks and resources with conflicting requirements. \par Detection and\slash or prevention of deadlocks can require massive amounts of additional overhead if efficient usage of resources is to be maintained. A resource management program is described which uses linked lists along with other techniques to overcome a large portion of this overhead. The program, which is currently running as part of a large scale general purpose operating system, keeps resources relatively active but does not detect or prevent all deadlocks in its implemented state. Certain changes, which would permit more comprehensive levels of deadlock prevention\slash detection at additional cost, have not been incorporated in the running system due to the infrequency of deadlock situations.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;Since the logical structure of a data base can be represented by a tree or graph, it is quite natural for us to view the process of designing a data base as that of constructing a tree or a graph. \par A general method for constructing such a tree or a graph is provided. There are three important elements in this general construction method; namely, a set of binary relations, an algorithm for constructing subsets of a set, and an algorithm for selecting an element from the given set of objects. The use of different relations and algorithms results in different information structures, as list, tree, ring, etc. Thus the problem of information organization and storage is reduced to that of defining relations and formulating algorithms under a given set of constraints. \par The results presented may be valuable to designers as useful design concepts, and may serve as a basis for developing a formal theory on the subject.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;COKO III is a chess player written entirely in Fortran. On the IBM 360-65, COKO III plays a minimal chess game at the rate of. 2 sec cpu time per move, with a level close to lower chess club play. A selective tree searching procedure controlled by tactical chess logistics allows a deployment of multiple minimal game calculations to achieve some optimal move selection. In addition, an interesting phenomenon called a tree searching catastrophe has plagued COKO's entire development just as it troubles a human player. Standard exponential growth is curbed to a large extent by the definition and trimming of the Fischer set. Representation of the chess environment is described along with a strategic preanalysis procedure that maps the Lasker regions. Specific chess algorithms are described which could be used as a command structure by anyone desiring to do some chess program experimentation. A comparison is made of some mysterious actions of human players and COKO III.&quot;,

The students are expected to have taken at least two programming courses prior to this one and, therefore, to be familiar with at least two programming languages, both as students and users. Teaching someone how to program is similar to teaching him to play a musical instrument: neither skill can be taught-they must be learned. However, the teacher still serves several vital purposes: to present a set of rules for producing well-formed utterances; to offer numerous demonstrations of his own skill; and to function as an involved critic. Finally, the teacher is the source of information about the process in which the student is involved.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;A learning program has been written in BASIC to play four-player partnership dominoes. Because dominoes is a game of incomplete information, the program uses somewhat different principles of artificial intelligence from those used in programs for games of complete information, such as checkers, chess, and go. The program was constructed to use a ``strategy signature table'' which classifies board situations through the interactions of game parameters. Each entry in the table contains adaptively determined weights indicating the advisability of various strategies. Once chosen, a strategy then employs probability analysis and linear polynomial evaluation to choose a move. Our program wins approximately two-thirds of its games in tournament situations, and has defeated championship players.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;The notions of data item, function, and relation. It is argued that the system is more suitable than set theory (or its derivatives) for the concise and accurate description of program semantics. It is shown how the system can be used to build composite data types out of simper ones with the operations of rowing, structuring, and uniting. It is also demonstrated that completely new primitive types can be introduced into languages through the mechanism of singleton data types. Both deterministic and nondeterministic functions are shown to be definable in the system. \par It is described how the local environment can be modeled as a data item and how imperative statements can be considered functions on the environment. The nature of recursive functions is briefly discussed, and a technique is presented by which they can be introduced into the system. The technique is contrasted with the use of the paradoxical combinator, Y. The questions of local and global environments and of various modes of function calling and parameter passing are touched upon. The theory is applied to the proof of several elementary theorems concerning the semantics of the assignment, conditional, and iterative statements. An appendix is included which presents in detail the formal system governing webs and fen, the abstractions used informally in the body of the paper.&quot;,

An experiment is performed to compare these trees with standard AVL trees and with balanced trees on the basis of mean retrieval time, of amount of restructuring expected, and on the worst case of retrieval time. It is shown that, by permitting imbalances of up to five units, the retrieval time is increased a small amount while the amount of restructuring required is decreased by a factor of ten. \par A few theoretical results are derived, including the correction of an earlier paper, and are duly compared with the experimental data. Reasonably good correspondence is found.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;Using ideas from information theory, this paper develops a heuristic algorithm that converts a limited entry decision table to a tree structured computer program with near minimum average processing time. The method is applicable to any limited entry decision table and does not require that actions have single rules or that the cost of testing conditions be equal. It is thus more general than the previously published heuristic algorithms. Compared to the optimal algorithm of Reinwald and Soland, this algorithm is easy to code and takes a much smaller translation time; it is thus felt that it is more useful in practice. The algorithm is well suited for manual conversion of decision tables to flowcharts.&quot;,

The problem is academic in the sense that ordinarily the optimal tree cannot be implemented by means of practical techniques. On the other hand, it is potentially useful for the comparison it affords between observed performance and that of an intuitively attractive ideal search procedure. As a practical application of such a model this paper considers the design of a novel tree search scheme based on a bit vector representation of data and shows that essentially the same algorithm can be used to design either an ideal search tree or a bit-vector tree. An experimental study of a small formatted file illustrates the concepts.&quot;,

Applications of this technique to multitasking, coroutines, backtracking, label-valued variables, and functional arguments are discussed. In the initial model, a single real processor is assumed, and the implementation assumes multiple-processes coordinate by passing control explicitly to one another.&quot;,

In this approach the keys in a file are assumed to have been selected from the key space according to a certain probabilistic selection algorithm. All files with the same number of keys selected from this key space will be suitably weighted in accordance with the algorithm, and the average performance of the transformation methods on these files will be used as the potential of these methods. Using this analysis, methods with the same overall performance can be classified and key distributions partial to certain transformations can be identified. All this can be done analytically. The approach is applied to a group of transformation methods using files whose keys are selected randomly.&quot;,

This language provides a means of expressing data and control structures suitable for exploiting ILLIAC IV parallelism. \par This paper reviews the hardware characteristics of the ILLIAC and singles out unconventional features which could be expected to influence language (and compiler) design. The implications of these features for data layout and algorithm structure are discussed, and the conclusion is drawn that data allocation rather than code structuring is the crucial ILLIAC optimization problem. A satisfactory method of data allocation is then presented. Language structures to utilize this storage method and express parallel algorithms are described.&quot;,

The dynamic verification of operating system decisions is used on the PRIME system being designed and constructed at the University of California, Berkeley. PRIME is an experimental time-sharing system which is to have the properties of continuous availability, data privacy, and cost effectiveness. The technique of dynamic verification allows the construction of an operating system which does not make certain decisions improperly even in the presence of a single hardware or software fault. Furthermore, multiple faults lead to unreliable operation only if the faults happen to reinforce each other. On PRIME, dynamic verification is used to ensure that one user's information cannot become available to another user gratuitously even in the presence of a single hardware or software fault.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;This paper describes a parser-generating system (PGS) currently in use on the CDC-6500 computer at Purdue University. The PGS is a FORTRAN-coded program that accepts a translation grammar as input and constructs from it a compact, machine-coded compiler. In the input translation grammar, each BNF syntactic rule corresponds to a (possibly empty) ``code generator'' realizable as an assembly language, FORTRAN or Algol, subroutine that is called whenever that syntactic rule is applied in the parse of a program. Typical one-pass compilers constructed by the PGS translate source programs at speeds approaching 14,000 cards per minute. For an XPL compiler, the parser program and its tables currently occupy 288 words of 60-bit core memory of which 140 words are parsing table entries and 82 words are links to code generators.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;The scan conversion algorithm that is described uses a linked list data structure to process the lines of the drawing in strips corresponding to groups of scan lines. A relatively small primary memory buffer area is used to accumulate the binary image for a group of scan lines. When this portion of the drawing has been plotted, the buffer is reused for the next portion. Because of the list processing procedures used, only a single pass through the XY display file is required when generating the binary image and only a slight increase in execution time over the fully buffered core results. Results show that storage requirements can be reduced by more than 80\% while causing less than a 10\% increase in execution time.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;The solution of linear systems having real, symmetric, diagonally dominant,tridiagonal coefficient matrices with constant diagonals is considered. It is proved that the diagonals of the LU decomposition converges when floating-point precision. It is also proved that the computed LU decomposition converges when floating-point arithmetic is used and that the limits of the LU diagonals using floating point are roughly within machine precision of the limits using real arithmetic. This fact is exploited to reduce the number of floating-point operations required to solve a linear system from $8n-7$ to $5n+2k-3$, where $k$ is much less than $n$, the order of the matrix. If the elements of the subdiagonals and superdiagonals are 1, then only $4n+2k-3$ operations are needed. The entire LU decomposition takes $k$ words of storage, and considerable savings in array subscripting are achieved. Upper and lower bounds on $k$ are obtained in terms of the ratio of the coefficient matrix diagonal constants and parameters of the floating-point number system. Various generalizations of these results are discussed.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;Tridiagonalizing a matrix by similarity transformations is an important computational tool in numerical linear algebra. Consider the class of sparse matrices which can be tridiagonalized using only row and corresponding column permutations. The advantages of using such a transformation include the absence of round-off errors and improved computation time when compared with standard transformations. \par A graph theoretic algorithm which examines an arbitrary $n \times n$ matrix and determines whether or not it can be permuted into tridiagonal form is given. The algorithm requires no arithmetic while the number of comparisons, the number of assignments, and the number of increments are linear in $n$. This compares very favorably with standard transformation methods. \par If the matrix is permutable into tridiagonal form, the algorithm gives the explicit tridiagonal form. Otherwise, early rejection will occur.&quot;,

A display is described which extends the capabilities of this organization to include general graphics. The feasibility of such a display is shown by deriving the minimum number of patterns required in the read only memory of the character generator to synthesize an arbitrary line. The synthesis process does not compromise picture quality, since the resulting dot patterns are identical with those of a conventional raster display. The time constraints of a raster display are shown to be satisfied for a typical design for very complex line drawings.&quot;,

This paper explores the use of a formal notation called Production Systems in providing a readable and complete formal definition of syntax. As a practical illustration, a small but significant subset of PL/I is considered. A more detailed presentation, as well as the application to define abstract syntax and translations between languages, is given in a previous paper by the author.&quot;,

Because this is tedious and error prone, producing a program with complete, correct predicates is reasonably difficult and would be facilitated by machine assistance. This paper discusses techniques for mechanically synthesizing loop predicates. Two classes of techniques are considered: (1) heuristic methods which derive loop predicates from boundary conditions and/or partially specified inductive assertions: (2) extraction methods which use input predicates and appropriate weak interpretations to obtain certain classes of loop predicates by an evaluation on the weak interpretation.&quot;,

The real workload is characterized by its demands on the various system resources. These characteristics of the real workload are obtained from the system accounting data. The characteristics of the drive workload are determined by matching the joint probability density of the real workload with that of the drive workload. The drive workload is realized by using a synthetic program in which the characteristics can be varied by varying the appropriate parameters. Calibration experiments are conducted to determine expressions relating the synthetic program parameters with the workload characteristics. The general method is applied to the case of two variables, cpu seconds and number of I/O activities; and a synthetic workload with 88 jobs is constructed to represent a month's workload consisting of about 6000 jobs.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;When the amount of space required for file storage exceeds the amount which can be kept online, decisions must be made as to which files are to be permanently resident and which mountable. These decisions will affect the number of mount requests issued to the operators. This is often a bottleneck in a computing facility, and reducing the number of mounts thus decreases turnaround time. An optimization model for the assignment of files to disk packs, and packs to either resident or nonresident status is presented. Heuristics are suggested for those cases in which it is inefficient to compute the actual optimum.&quot;,

A display has been described which extends the capabilities of this organization to include general graphics. Two fundamentally different scan conversion algorithms which have been developed to support this display are presented. One is most suitable to noninteractive applications and the other to interactive applications. The algorithms were implemented in Fortran on the CDC6400 computer. Results obtained from the implementations show that the noninteractive algorithms can significantly reduce display file storage requirements at little cost in execution time over that of a conventional raster display. The interactive algorithm improve response time and reduce storage requirements.&quot;,

The resulting model is easy to manipulate, and is applicable to such diverse problems as choosing an optimum size for a paging memory, arranging for reproducible memory usage charges, and estimating the amount of core memory sharing.&quot;,

Probability distribution functions and other data are given for such things as CPU intervals, I/O intervals, and the number of such intervals during execution.

  abstract =     &quot;Two new algorithms are presented for list structure copying using bounded workspace. The first, of primarily theoretical interest, shows that without cell tag bits the task can be performed in time n**2. The second algorithm, assuming one tag bit in each cell, delivers attractive practical speed. Any noncyclic structure is copied in linear speed, while cyclic structures are copied in average time less than n log n. No foreknowledge of cycle absence is necessary to achieve linear speed. A variation of the second algorithm solves an open problem concerning list structure marking. That result demonstrates that marking can be done in average time n log n without the aid of supplemental tag bits or stacks.&quot;,

This is achieved by using a modified variable tracing mechanism invented by Green in 1969. The correctness of the improved algorithm is also proved; i.e. the program thus obtained always satisfies the specification.&quot;,

This paper describes the use of simulation techniques to predict the savings in compilation cost achievable by such an approach. The results suggest a function which describes the effect of changes in the power of a language on the compilation cost of an algorithm expressed in that language: when features not actually used by the algorithm are removed from the language, the cost of compiling the algorithm decreases moderately, but when features that are needed are removed, the compilation cost increases sharply.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;This paper presents the background and algorithms for masking the rotational latency of a disk or drum. It discusses the anticipatory input and output of blocks of data to buffer and primary memories for a mono-programmed computer system. A basic permutation algorithm and several variations are given. Because of the anticipatory nature of the I/O scheduling, these algorithms are restricted to classes of programs with predictable behavior. While the methods are not restricted to numerical computations, matrix and partial differential equation methods are typical examples of their use. It is shown tha latency may be masked using a small amount of buffer memory. The methods discussed are independent of the overall size of the data base being considered.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;Two languages enabling their users to estimate the efficiency of computer programs are presented. The program whose efficiency one wishes to estimate is written in the first language, a go-to-less programming language which includes most of the features of Algol 60. The second language consists of interactive commands enabling its users to provide additional information about the program written in the first language and to output results estimating its efficiency. Processors for the two languages are also described. The first processor is a syntax-directed translator which compiles a program into a symbolic formula representing the execution time for that program. The second processor is a set of procedures for algebraic manipulation which can be called by the user to operate on the formula produced by the first processor. Examples of the usage of the two languages are included. The limitations of the present system, its relation to Knuth's work on the analysis of algorithms, and some of the directions for further research are also discussed.&quot;,

Mechanisms are presented for dealing with objects, including the creation of new types, specification of new operations applicable to a given type, sharing, and protection of any reference to a given object against improper application of any of the operations defined with respect to that type of object. The mechanisms provide a coherent basis for extension of the system in two directions: the introduction of new facilities, and the creation of highly secure systems.&quot;,

A novel method is presented, which maps the hyperbolic frequency distribution. This is more suited to implementation on storage devices. \par This method treats text as a string of characters rather than words bounded by spaces, and chooses subsets of strings such that their frequencies of occurrence are more even than those of word types. The members of this subset are then used as index keys for retrieval. The rectangular distribution of key frequencies results in a much simplified file organization and promises considerable cost advantages.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;In many computer operating systems a user authenticates himself by entering a secret password known solely to himself and the system. The system compares this password with one recorded in a Password Table which is available to only the authentication program. The integrity of the system depends on keeping the table secret. In this paper a password scheme is presented which does not require secrecy in the computer. All aspects of the system, including all relevant code and data bases, may be known by anyone attempting to intrude. The scheme is based on using a function H which the would-be intruder is unable to invert. This function is applied to the user's password and the result compared to a table entry, a match being interpreted as authentication of the user. The intruder may know all about H and have access to the table, but he can penetrate the system only if he can invert H to determine an input that produces a given output. This paper discusses issues surrounding selection of a suitable H.&quot;,

By using one-way ciphers to code the passwords, the risks involved with storing the passwords in the computer can be avoided. The selection of a suitable one-way cipher is discussed. It is suggested that for this purpose polynomials over a prime modulus are superior to one-way ciphers derived from Shannon codes.&quot;,

The time required for selecting and fetching the plaintext data and for storing the ciphertext was separately measured (the ``null transformation'' ), and was then compared with the times required by each enciphering method. The enciphering processes required at least four times as much cpu time when programmed in Fortran.&quot;,

Several relationships are established between the class-teacher timetable problem and graphs with preconditions. These preconditions place additional restrictions on the coloration of a graph. The preconditions correspond to the unavailability constraints and preassigned meetings in the class-teacher timetable problem. Using some recent results that convert graphs with preconditions to graphs without them, it is shown that the existence of a coloration of a graph is the required necessary and sufficient condition.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;A new integration algorithm is found, and an implementation is compared with other programmed algorithms. The new algorithm is a step-by-step procedure for solving the initial value problem in ordinary differential equations. It is designed to approximate poles of small integer order in the solutions of the differential equations by continued fractions obtained by manipulating the sums of truncated Taylor series expansions. The new method is compared with Gragg-Bulirsh-Stoer, and the Taylor series method. \par The Taylor series method and the new method are shown to be superior in speed and accuracy, while the new method is shown to be most superior when the solution is required near a singularity. The new method can finally be seen to pass automatically through singularities where all the other methods which are discussed will have failed.&quot;,

The weighted buddy method allows block sizes of $2^k$ and $3(2^k)$, whereas the original buddy method allowed only block sizes of $2^k$. This extension is achieved at an additional cost of only two bits per block. Simulation results are presented which compare this method with the buddy method. These results indicate that for a uniform request distribution, the buddy system has less total memory fragmentation than the weighted buddy algorithm. However, the total fragmentation is smaller for the weighted buddy method when the requests are for exponentially distributed block sizes.&quot;,

Deletions can result in unreachable data elements, and there is no guarantee that additions will be performed properly. To remedy this situation, this paper proposes a data structure description and manipulation language which provides for the creation of a restricted class of data structures but ensures the correctness of the program. This is accomplished by an explicit structure declaration facility, a restriction on the permissible operations, and execution-time checks.&quot;,

The method is particularly suited to those systems where primary memory is managed according to a working set strategy. It is based on the concept of critical working set, a working set which does not contain the next memory reference. The data the method operates upon are extracted from a trace of the program to be restructured. It is shown that, except in some special cases, the method is not optimum. However, the experimental results obtained by using the method to restructure an interactive text editor and the file system module of an operating system have shown its substantial superiority over the other methods proposed in the literature.&quot;,

Fundamental to the method is a set of productions together with sets of applicability rules and weight rules which operate on the productions deciding when and to what extent they are available for use. Several rounds generated by the computer implementation of the method are presented. Generally, the resultant music sounds mediocre to the professional although usually pleasing to the layman. It appears that full-blown music theory is not needed for rounds --- all the hardware required for structural levels is not necessary for these pieces. The author has tried to address both musicians and computer scientists.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;When the shape parameter, alpha, is integral, generating gamma random variables with a digital computer is straightforward. There is no simple method for generating gamma random variates with non-integral shape parameters. A common procedure is to approximately generate such random variables by the use of the so-called probability switch method. Another procedure, which is exact, is due to Joehnk. This paper presents a rejection method for exactly generating gamma random variables when alpha is greater than 1. The efficiency of the rejection method is shown to be better than the efficiency of M. D. Joehnk's method. The paper concludes that when alpha is non-integral, the following mix of procedures yields the best combination of accuracy and efficiency: (1) when alpha is less than 1, use Joehnk's method; (2) when 1 is less than alpha and alpha is less than 5, use the rejection method; (3) when alpha is greater than 5, use the probability switch method.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;The problem classically titled ``The Examination Schedule Problem'' takes various forms in the literature. Most of these formulations can be presented in the terminology of classical Network Theory. \par One such formulation is: Given a nondirected network, partition its nodes into a minimal number of subsets such that no two members of the same subset are connected by an arc. An obvious lower limit to this number is the size of the largest strongly connected subgraph. Kirchgassner proved that an upper limit is this size plus one. One logical extension of the previous work is the introduction of variable length examinations where $W(I)$ is the number of periods for exam $I$. The object of this paper is to generalize the definition of largest strongly connected subgraph to include the weighting of nodes, to present an approximate algorithm which usually finds the largest strongly connected subgraph, and to discuss the application of this algorithm to the solution of school scheduling and exam scheduling problems.&quot;,

It is, in general, second order except for the case of a linear system with constant coefficients and linear forcing terms; in that case, the method is third order. It has been implemented and put to routine usage in biological applications-where stiffness frequently appears-with favorable results. When compared to a standard fourth order Runge-Kutta implementation, computation time required by this method has ranged from comparable for certain nonstiff problems to better than two orders of magnitude faster for some highly stiff systems.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;Heuristic procedures are presented which have been developed to perform inferences by generalizing from available information. The procedures make use of a similarity structure which is imposed on the data base using nonnumerical clustering algorithms. They are implemented in a model fact retrieval system which uses a formal query language and a property-list data structure. A program of experiments is described wherein the procedures are used with test data bases which are altered by deleting part of the data and by purposely introducing false data. It is found that the system can infer the correct response under a variety of conditions involving incomplete and inconsistent data.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;Structured programming has proved to be an important methodology for systematic program design and development. Structured programs are identified as compound function expressions in the algebra of functions. The algebraic properties of these function expressions permit the reformulation (expansion as well as reduction) of a nested subexpression independently of its environment, thus modeling what is known as stepwise program refinement as well as program execution. Finally, structured programming is characterized in terms of the selection and solution of certain elementary equations defined in the algebra of functions. These solutions can be given in general formulas, each involving a single parameter, which display the entire freedom available in creating correct structure programs.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;Usually n decimal digits are represented by 4n bits in computers. Actually, two BCD digits can be compressed optimally and reversibly into 7 bits, and three digits into 10 bits, by a very simple algorithm based on the fixed-length combination of two variable field-length encodings. In over half of the cases the compressed code results from the conventional BCD code by simple removal of redundant 0 bits. A long decimal message can be subdivided into three-digit blocks, and separately compressed; the result differs from the asymptotic minimum length by only 0.34 percent. The hardware requirement is small, and the mappings can be done manually.&quot;,

Three criteria are given for A$(0)$-stability. It is shown that (1) for $p=k$, $k$ arbitrary, $A(\infty)$-stability implies certain necessary conditions for $A(0)$-stability and for strict stability (meaning that the extraneous roots of $p(\psi)$ satisfy $|\psi|&lt;1)$; (2) for $p=k=2,3,4, \mbox{and} 5$, $A(\infty)$-stability (for $k=5$ together with another constraint) implies strict stability; and (3) for certain one-parameter classes of formulas with $p=k=3,4,\mbox{and/or} 5$, $A(\infty)$-stability implies $A(0)$-stability.&quot;,

And it is designed as a structured program, which can readily be coded by the reader in the high level or low level programming language of his choice. Practical tests of the method have shown it to be a good basis for a realistic timetabling algorithm.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;This paper describes the design and implementation of a system for typesetting mathematics. \par The language has been designed to be easy to learn and to use by people (for example, secretaries and mathematical typists) who know neither mathematics nor typesetting. Experience indicates that the language can be learned in an hour or so, for it has few rules and fewer exceptions. For typical expressions, the size and font changes, positioning, line drawing, and the like necessary to print according to mathematical conventions are all done automatically. For example, the input {\tt sum from i=0 to infinity x sub i=pi over 2} produces $\sum_{i=0}^\infty x_i = \pi/2$. The syntax of the language is specified by a small context-free grammar; a compiler-compiler is used to make a compiler that translates this language into typesetting commands. Output maybe produced on either a phototypesetter or on a terminal with forward and reverse half-line motions. The system interfaces directly with text formatting programs, so mixtures of text and mathematics may be handled simply. This paper was typeset by the authors using the system described.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;GLYPNIR is one of the earliest existing languages designed for programming the Illiac IV computer. The syntax of the language is based on ALGOL 60, but has been extended to allow the programmer explicitly to specify the parallelism of his algorithm in terms of 64-word vectors. This paper describes the characteristics, goals, and philosophy of the language, and discusses some of the problems associated with parallel computer architectures.&quot;,

An examination of Patil's proof shows that he has established this claim only under strong restrictions on the use of $P$ and $V$. These restrictions eliminate programming techniques used by Dijkstra and others since the first introduction of the semaphore concept. This paper contains a solution to the problem. It also discusses the need for the generalized operators suggested by Patil.&quot;,

In-depth studies were conducted of the latter two nets. Based on the experiences of these operating networks, a number of factors are identified for consideration in developing networks. Finally, recommendations are advanced regarding the development of networks in higher education in the future.&quot;,

Two algorithms to perform addition are described. For practical designers, the technique has the advantage that operations are concise, readily composed, and are given in terms of easily imagined solids. Quite short sequences of operations suffice to build up complex solids bounded by many faces.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;Four algorithms are considered which can be used to schedule events in a general purpose discrete simulation system. Two of the algorithms are new, one is based on an end-order tree structure for event notices, and another uses an indexed linear list. The algorithms are tested with a set of typical stochastic scheduling distributions especially chosen to show the advantages and limitations of the algorithms. \par The end-order tree algorithm is shown to be an advantageous, immediate replacement for the algorithm in use with current simulation languages. The most promising algorithm uses the indexed list concept. \par It will require an adaptive routine before it can be employed in general purpose simulators,but its performance is such that further study would be fruitful.&quot;,

The inverted data base (file) organization is then analyzed, considering implementation oriented aspects. The inverted directory is viewed realistically as another large data base which itself is subjected to inversion. Formulations are derived to estimate average access time (read only) and storage requirements, formalizing the interaction of data base content characteristics, logical complexity of queries, and machine timing and blocking specifications identified as having a first-order effect on performance. The formulations presented are necessary to be used in conjunction with any index selection criteria to determine the optimum set of index keys.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;The quality of computer generated images of three-dimensional scenes depends on the shading technique used to paint the objects on the cathode-ray tube screen. The shading algorithm itself depends in part on the method for modeling the object, which also determines the hidden surface algorithm. The various methods of object modeling, shading, and hidden surface removal are thus strongly interconnected. Several shading techniques corresponding to different methods of object modeling and the related hidden surface algorithms are presented here. Human visual perception and the fundamental laws of optics are considered in the development of a shading rule that provides better quality and increased realism in generated images.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;The trend in computer systems is toward the use of multilevel storage hierarchy systems. In this kind of system, data set allocation is usually based on qualitative, ad hoc decisions. If automatic data migration is used at all, the data sets are allocated to slower level memories simply on the basis of an ad hoc threshold against a time interval since the last use. To achieve quantitative, more optimal allocation, both storage cost and access time cost must be carefully analyzed. This paper presents an appropriate automatic algorithm which includes many significant details of both costs.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;This paper compares a new method of simulation organization, called the significant event method, with an old one, called the clock pulse method, using as examples two automobile traffic models. The significant event method is found to be more efficient than the clock pulse method at low levels of system interaction and less efficient at high levels. A simple mathematical model for the trade-off in the relative running time of the two methods is developed. The model aids in choosing between the two simulation methods for a particular experiment. It is concluded that the significant event method can be of value in the simulation of some systems when computational efficiency is of sufficient importance.&quot;,

The algorithm consists of constructing a finite state pattern matching machine from the keywords and then using the pattern matching machine to process the text string in a single pass. Construction of the pattern matching machine takes time proportional to the sum of the lengths of the keywords. The number of state transitions made by the pattern matching machine in processing the text string is independent of the number of keywords. The algorithm has been used to improve the speed of a library bibliographic search program by a factor of 5 to 10.&quot;,

This paper presents a method for significantly reducing the time spent scanning future event lists in discrete event simulations. \par There models are presented, all of which improve in effectiveness as the events-list scan problem becomes more burdensome.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;A step-by-step approach to model the dynamic behavior and evaluate the performance of computing systems is proposed. It is based on a technique of variable aggregation and the concept of nearly decomposable systems, both borrowed from Econometrics. This approach is taken in order to identify in multiprogramming paging systems (i) unstable regimes of operations and (ii) critical computing loads which bring the system into states of saturation. This analysis leads to a more complete definition of the circumstances in which ``thrashing'' can set in.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;The paper describes the internal structure of a large operating system as a set of cooperating sequential processes. The processes synchronize by means of semaphores and extended semaphores (queue semaphores). The number of parallel processes is carefully justified, and the various semaphore constructions are explained. The system is proved to be free of ``deadly embrace'' (deadlock). The design principle is an alternative to Dijkstra's hierarchical structuring of operating systems. The project management and the performance are discussed, too. The operating system is the first large one using the RC 4000 multiprogramming system.&quot;,

Three theorems are introduced to show that one side of the minimum-area rectangle must be colinear with an edge of the enclosed polygon and that the minimum-area encasing rectangle for the convex polygon is also the minimum-area rectangle for the curve.&quot;,

In the use of hash search described in this paper, the key field is the virtual address of a machine cell with which additional information is associated. An address to auxiliary data not contained in that cell is called hash linking. (A hash link function is one which maps any machine virtual address into another unique address where additional information can be stored. ) This note describes several nonobvious applications of this technique.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;Report on some experiments whose results have helped to understand differences in the performance of two well-known storage-allocation strategies, first-fit and best-fit. For exponential and hyperexponential distributions of requests, first-fit outperformed best-fit; but for normal and uniform distributions, and for exponential distributions distorted in various ways, best-fit outperformed first-fit. It is hypothesized that when first-fit outperforms best-fit, it does so because first-fit, by preferentially allocating toward one end of memory, encourages large blocks to grow at the other end. Sufficient contiguous space is thereby more likely to be available for relatively large requests. Results of simulation experiments supported this hypothesis and showed that the relative performance of first-fit and best-fit depends on the frequency of requests that are large compared to the average request. when the coefficient of variation of the request distribution is greater than or approximately equal to unity, first-fit outperformed best-fit.&quot;,

Some theorems which provide tools for reducing redundancy in CRWR organizations have been also developed. Redundancies obtained by the application of these theorems are compared with that of query-inverted file organizations. Some CRWR organizations with minimum redundancy have also been developed for queries which specify sets of keys.&quot;,

This method is logically equivalent to the Quine-McCluskey method for finding prime implicants. If some of the decision rules implied in the ELSE Rule occur with low frequency, then the ELSE Rule can be used to further simplify the decision table. Several objectives merit consideration in optimizing a decision table. (1) reducing machine execution time; (2) reducing preprocessing time; (3) reducing required machine memory; (4) reducing the number of decision rules. Objectives (3) and (4) can be furthered with the above methods. Objective (1) is also attained if overspecified decision rules are not combined. Objective (2) must be compared against the potential benefits of objectives (1), (3), and (4) in deciding whether to use the above methods.&quot;,

The necessary capabilities of each processor are defined, as well as interprocessor communication and interlocks. Complete procedures for garbage collection and for standard list processing primitives are presented and thoroughly explained. Particular attention is given to the problems of marking and relocating list cells while another processor may be operating on them. The primary aim throughout is to allow the list processor to run unimpeded while the other processor reclaims list storage. The more complex cases involving several list processors and one or more garbage collection processors are also briefly discussed.&quot;,

Using standard queueing theory, each disk drive is characterized by a queueing model with service time of a disk drive represented by the probability density function of the sum of two uniform distributions. Total response time of the set of disk models is then minimized under varying load conditions. The results indicate that faster devices should have higher utilization factors and that the number of different device types utilized tends to decrease with decreasing load.

  abstract =     &quot;A relational algebra interface, called SQUIRAL, is described in detail. SQUIRAL seeks to minimize query response time and space utilization by: (1) performing global query optimization, (2) exploiting disjoint and pipelined concurrency, (3) coordinating sort orders in temporary relations, (4) employing directory analysis, and (5) maintaining locality in page references. Algorithms for implementing the operators of E. F. Codd's relational algebra are presented, and a methodology for composing them to optimize the performance of a particular user query is described.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;SEQUEL is a nonprocedural language which does not make use of quantifiers or other mathematical concepts; rather, SEQUEL uses a block structured format of English key words (hence the acronym ``Structured English Query Language'' ). SEQUEL is intended for interactive, problem solving use by people who have need for interaction with a large database but who are not trained programmers. This class of users includes urban planners, sociologists, accountants, and other professionals. The objective of the language is to provide a simple, easy-to-learn means of expressing the primitive actions used by people to obtain information from tables, such as ``look up a value in a column.'' SEQUEL and its companion language, SQUARE, have been shown to be relationally complete, i.e. equivalent in power to Codd's relational calculus.&quot;,

The paper presents an algorithm for merging A and B with the p parallel processors, which requires at most 2 left bracket log//2(2m plus 1) right bracket plus left bracket 3m/p right bracket plus left bracket m/p right bracket left bracket log//2(n/m) right bracket steps. If n equals 2** beta m ( beta an integer), the algorithm requires at most 2 left bracket log//2(m plus 1) right bracket plus left bracket m/p right bracket (2 plus beta ) steps. In the case where m and n are of the same order of magnitude, i.e. n equals km with k being a constant, the algorithm requires 2 left bracket log//2(m plus 1) right bracket plus right bracket m/p right bracket (3 plus k) steps. These performances compare very favorably with the previous best parallel merging algorithm, Batcher's algorithm, which requires n/p plus ((m plus n)/2p)log//2m steps in the general case and km/p plus ((k plus l)/2)(m/p)log//2m in the special case where n equals km.&quot;,

An approach based on space density computations is used to choose an optimum indexing vocabulary for a collection of documents.

In conclusion, the impact of theoretical results on the practicing programmer and the importance of one-in, one-out control structures as operational abstractions are discussed.

The split between pure and applied mathematics is found similarly in programming. The development of natural languages toward flexionless, word-order based language types speaks for programming language design based on general, abstract constructs. By analogy with incidents of the history of artificial, auxiliary languages it is suggested that Fortran and Cobol will remain dominant for a long time to come. The most promising avenues for further work of wide influence are seen to be high quality program literature (i.e. programs) of general utility and studies of questions related to program style.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;Attribute grammars are an extension of context-free grammars devised by Knuth as a mechanism for including the semantics of a context-free language with the syntax of the language. The circularity problem for a grammar is to determine whether the semantics for all possible sentences (programs) in fact will be well defined. It is proved that this problem is, in general, computationally intractable. Specifically, it is shown that any deterministic algorithm which solves the problem must for infinitely many cases use an exponential amount of time. An improved version of Knuth's circularity testing algorithm is also given, which actually solves the problem within exponential time.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;The problem of determining whether an arbitrary context-free grammar is a member of some easily parsed subclass of grammars such as the LR(k) grammars is considered. The time complexity of this problem is analyzed both when k is considered to be a fixed integer and when k is considered to be a parameter of the test. In the first case, it is shown that for every k there exists an O(n**k** plus **2) algorithm for testing the LR(k) property, where n is the size of the grammar in question. On the other hand, if both k and the subject grammar are problem parameters, then the complexity of the problem depends very strongly on the representation chosen for k. More specifically, it is shown that this problem is NP-complete when k is expressed in unary. When k is expressed in binary the problem is complete for nondeterministic exponential time. These results carry over to many other parameterized classes of grammars, such as the LL(k), strong LL(k), SLR(k), and strong LC(k) grammars.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;A new algorithm for global flow analysis on reducible graphs is presented. The algorithm is shown to treat a very general class of function spaces. \par For a graph of $e$ edges, the algorithm has a worst case time bound of $O(e \log e)$ function operations. \par It is also shown that in programming terms, the number of operations is proportional to $e$ plus the number of exits from program loops. Consequently a restriction to one-entry one-exit control structures linearity. The algorithm can be extended to yet larger classes of function spaces and graphs by relaxing the time bound. Examples are given of code improvement problems which can be solved using the algorithm.&quot;,

This paper describes the structure of an optimizer for this language. Among other methods of interest, the optimizer uses techniques which allow relations of inclusion and membership to be established, the domains and ranges of (tabulated) mappings to be estimated from above and below, and the single-valuedness of (tabulated) mappings to be proved. Once facts of this kind have been established, automatic choice of data structures becomes possible. The methods employed are based upon, and extend, known techniques of data flow analysis.&quot;,

Adaptive routing tends to overuse the direct path and underuse alternate routes because it does not consider the impact of its current routing decision on the future state of the network. The form of the optimality conditions suggests that a modification of the adaptive algorithm will result in optimality. The modification requires the substitution of a quadratic bias term instead of a linear one in the routing table maintained at each network node.

  abstract =     &quot;This paper describes attribute grammars and their use for the definition of programming languages and compilers; a formal definition of attribute grammars and a discussion of some of its important aspects are included. The paper concentrates on the evaluation of semantic attributes in a few passes from left to right over the derivation tree of a program. A condition for an attribute grammar is given which assures that the semantics of any program can be evaluated in a single pass over the derivation tree, and an algorithm is discussed which decides how many passes from left to right are in general necessary, given the attribute grammar. These notions are explained in terms of an example grammar which describes the scope rules of Algol 60. Practical questions, such as the relative efficiency of different evaluation schemes, and the ease of adapting the attribute grammar of a given programming language to the left-to-right evaluation scheme are discussed.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;This paper examines a class of heuristics for maintaining a sequential list in approximately optimal order with respect to the average time required to search for a specified element, assuming that each element is searched for with a fixed probability independent of previous searches performed. The ``move to front'' and ``transposition'' heuristics are shown to be optimal to within a constant factor, and the transposition rule is shown to be the more efficient of the two. Empirical evidence suggests that transposition is in fact optimal for any distribution of search probabilities.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;Classical permutation enumeration algorithms encounter special cases requiring additional computation every nth permutation when generating the n! permutations on n marks. Four new algorithms have the attribute that special cases occur every n(n minus 1) permutations. Two of the algorithms produce the next permutation with a single exchange of two marks. The other two algorithms infrequently exchange more than two marks, but the rules for generating the next permutation are very simple. Performance tests which have counted execution of assignment statements, comparisons, arithmetic operations, and subscripted array references have shown superiority of the new algorithms compared to Boothroyd's implementation of M. B. Wells' algorithm and Erlich's implementation of the Johnson-Trotter algorithm.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;This paper presents a method for detecting edges and contours in noisy pictures. The properties of an edge are embedded in a figure of merit and the edge detection problem becomes the problem of minimizing the given figure of merit. This problem can be represented as a shortest path problem on a graph and can be solved using well-known graph search algorithms. The relations between this representation of the minimization problem and a dynamic programming approach are discussed, showing that the graph search method can lead to substantial improvements in computing time. Moreover, if heuristic search methods are used, the computing time will depend on the amount of noise in the picture. Some experimental results are given; these show how various information about the shape of the contour of an object can be embedded in the figure of merit, thus allowing the extraction of contours from noisy pictures and the separation of touching objects.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;This paper is concerned with the control over what a user is allowed to do with a piece of information supplied to him by the database. The ability to condition the supply of information on its intended use is called here ``intentional resolution'' of privacy protection. The practical importance of intentional resolution is demonstrated by several examples, and its realization is discussed. It appears to be necessary for the database to impose a certain amount of control over the internal behavior of users' programs which interact with it. A model for user-database interaction which admits such a control is developed.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;A conversational programming language for analytic geometry is described, together with some aspects of its implementation. The language allows the flexible definition of geometric objects and elements, computes their parameters, and displays the results. It also provides the capability of specifying a geometric figure via a collection of parameters and displaying various loci corresponding to these parameters. A third characteristic consists of the possibility of using this language to design other user oriented languages. LG has been specifically designed for use by nonprogrammers; it is easy to learn and very close to the natural language used in geometry.&quot;,

As a unified solution to these problems, this paper suggests conducting a logical analysis of programs by using invariants which express what is actually occurring in the program. Techniques for the automatic generation of invariants are examined. Criteria for using the invariants to check simultaneously for correctness (including termination) or incorrectness are provided. Implications of the approach for the automatic diagnosis and correction of logical errors are discussed.&quot;,

These mechanisms are examined within a mathematical framework suitable for formulating the requirements of secure information flow among security classes. The central component of the model is a lattice structure derived from the security classes and justified by the semantics of information flow. The model provides a unifying view of all systems that restrict information flow, enables a classification of them according to security objectives, and suggests some new approaches. It also leads to the construction of automatic program certification mechanisms for verifying the secure flow of information through a program.&quot;,

The information in a partial correctness proof can be used to prove such properties as mutual exclusion, freedom from deadlock, and program termination. Techniques for verifying these properties are presented and illustrated by application to the dining philosophers problem. The language and axioms offered give guides for the construction of correct and comprehensible programs.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;The term ``locality'' is used to denote that subset of a program's segments which are referenced during a particular phase of its execution. In this paper the concept of a locality is made more explicit through a formal definition of what constitutes a phase of localized reference behavior, and by a corresponding mechanism for the detection of localities in actual reference strings. This definition provides for the existence of a hierarchy of localities at any given time. empirical data from a sample of production Algol 60 programs is used to display distributions of locality sizes and lifetimes. These results are discussed in terms of their implications for the modeling of program behavior and memory management in virtual memory systems.&quot;,

An optimum page replacement algorithm, called VMIN, is described and shown to be optimum with respect to this criterion.

  abstract =     &quot;An analytical model is presented to estimate the performance of the Page Fault Frequency (PFF) replacement algorithm. In this model, program behavior is represented by the LRU stack distance model and the PFF replacement algorithm is represented by a semi-Markov model. Using these models, such parameters as the inter-page-fault interval distribution, the probability of the number of distinct pages being referenced during an inter-page-fault interval, etc., may be analytically determined. Using these models to evaluate these parameter values permits study of the performance of the replacement algorithm by simulating the page fault events rather than every page reference event. This significantly reduces the required computation time in estimating the performance of the PFF algorithm.&quot;,

Guidelines for selecting identifier transformations, overflow techniques, loading factors, bucket sizes, and loading order are considered. Particular attention is focused on the reasonableness of common heuristics for determining primary or secondary bucket sizes. A mathematical model which explicitly considers storage device characteristics and time\slash space cost tradeoffs is used to analyze the effect of design parameters on overall system costs. A specific design example is presented and solved.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;Two formal models for parallel computation are presented: an abstract conceptual model and a parallel-program model. The former model does not distinguish between control and data states. The latter model is includes the capability for the representation of an infinite set of control states by allowing there to be arbitrarily many instruction pointers (or processes) executing the program. An induction principle is presented which treats the control and data state sets on the same ground. Through the use of ``place variables'', it is observed that certain correctness conditions can be expressed without enumeration of the set of all possible control states. Examples are presented in which the induction principle is used to demonstrate proofs of mutual exclusion. Also discussed is an extension of the program model which allows each process to have its own local variables and permits shared global variables. Correctness of certain forms of implementation is also discussed.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;This paper describes the symbolic execution of programs. Instead of supplying the normal inputs to a program (e.g. numbers) one supplies symbols representing arbitrary values. The execution proceeds as in a normal execution except that values may be symbolic formulas over the input symbols. The difficult, yet interesting issues arise during the symbolic execution of conditional branch type statements. A particular system called EFFIGY which provides symbolic execution for program testing and debugging is also described. It interpretively executes programs written in a simple PL/I style programming language. It includes many standard debugging features, the ability to manage and to prove things about symbolic expressions, a simple program testing manager, and a program verifier. A brief discussion of the relationship between symbolic execution and program proving is also included.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;Ethernet is a branching broadcast communication system for carrying digital data packets among locally distributed computing stations. The packet transport mechanism provided by Ethernet has been used to build systems which can be viewed as either local computer networks or loosely coupled multiprocessors. \par An Ethernet's shared communication facility, its Ether, is a passive broadcast medium with no central control. Coordination of access to the Ether for packet broadcasts is distributed among the contending transmitting stations using controlled statistical arbitration. \par Switching of packets to their destinations on the Ether is distributed among the receiving stations using packet address recognition. Design principles and implementation are described, based on experience with an operating Ethernet of 100 nodes along a kilometer of coaxial cable. A model for estimating performance under heavy loads and a packet protocol for error controlled communication are included for completeness.&quot;,

Then the semantic concepts of environments, stores, and continuations are introduced to model classes of programming language features and the underlying mathematical theory of computation due to Scott is motivated and outlined.

  abstract =     &quot;A model of protection mechanisms in computing systems is presented and its appropriateness is argued. The ``safety'' problem for protection systems under this model is to determine in a given situation whether a subject can acquire a particular right to an object. In restricted cases, it can be shown that this problem is decidable; i.e., there is an algorithm to determine whether a system in a particular configuration is safe. In general, and under surprisingly weak assumptions, it cannot be decided if a situation is safe. Various implications of this fact are discussed.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;List processing systems often use a method called garbage collection for reclaiming unused memory space. A real time garbage collection system avoids suspending the operations of a list processor for the long times that garbage collection normally requires by performing garbage collection on a second processor in parallel with list processing operations, or on a single processor time-shared with them. Algorithms for recovering discarded list structures in this manner are presented and analyzed to determine sufficient conditions under which the list processor never need to wait on the collector. These techniques are shown to require at most twice as much processing power as regular garbage collectors, if they are used efficiently. The average behavior of the program is shown to be very nearly equal to the worst-case performance, so that the sufficient conditions are also suitable for measuring the typical behavior of the algorithm.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;This paper describes a new way of solving the storage reclamation problem for a system such as Lisp that allocates storage automatically from a heap, and does not require the programmer to give any indication that particular items are no longer useful or accessible. A reference count scheme for reclaiming non-self-referential structures, and a linearizing, compacting, copying scheme to reorganize all storage at the users discretion are proposed. The algorithms are designed to work well in systems which use multiple levels of storage, and large virtual address space. They depend on the fact that most cells are referenced exactly once, and that reference counts need only be accurate when storage is about to be reclaimed. A transaction file stores changes to reference counts, and a multiple reference table stores the count for items which are referenced more than once.&quot;,

This note presents an algorithm which improves on previous context tree retrieval algorithms. It is based on the observation that in typical uses context changes are infrequent relative to retrievals, so that data can be cached to speed up retrieval. A retrieval is started from the position of the previous retrieval and auxiliary structures are built up to make the search rapid. Algorithms for addition and deletion of data and for garbage collection are outlined.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;In 1974 E. A. Catmull developed a new algorithm for rendering images of bivariate surface patches. This paper describes extensions of this algorithm in the areas of texture simulation and lighting models. The parametrization of a patch defines a coordinate system which is used as a key for mapping patterns onto the surface. The intensity of the pattern at each picture element is computed as a weighted average of regions of the pattern definition function. The shape and size of this weighting function are chosen using digital signal processing theory. The patch rendering algorithm allows accurate computation of the surface normal to the patch at each picture element, permitting the simulation of mirror reflections. Several examples of images synthesized using these new techniques are included.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;By using an extension of traditional structure information, or a geometric hierarchy, five significant improvements to current techniques of computer picture production are possible. First, the range of complexity of an environment is greatly increased while the visible complexity of any given scene is kept within a fixed upper limit. Second, a meaningful way is provided to vary the amount of detail presented in a scene. Third, ``clipping'' becomes a very fast logarithmic search for the resolvable parts of the environment within the field of view. Fourth, frame to frame coherence and clipping define a graphical ``working set,'' or fraction of the total structure that should be present in primary store for immediate access by the visible surface algorithm. Finally, the geometric structure suggests a recursive descent, visible surface algorithm in which the computation time potentially grows linearly with the visible complexity of the scene.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;An algorithm for drawing pictures of three-dimensional objects, with surfaces made up of patches of quadric surfaces, is described. The emphasis of this algorithm is on calculating the intersections of quadric surfaces. A parameterization scheme is used. Each quadric surface intersection curve (QSIC) is represented as a set of coefficients and parameter limits. Each value of the parameter represents at most two points, and these may easily be distinguished. This scheme can find the coordinates of points of even quartic (fourth-order) intersection curves, using equations of no more than second order. Methods of parameterization for each type of QSIC are discussed, as well as surface bounding and hidden surface removal.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;A significant increase in the capability for controlling motion dynamics in key frame animation is achieved through skeleton control. This technique allows an animator to develop a complex motion sequence by animating a stick figure representation of an image. This control sequence is then used to drive an image sequence through the same movement. \par The simplicity of the stick figure image encourages a high level of interaction during the design stage. Its compatibility with the basic key frame animation technique permits skeleton control to be applied selectively to only those components of a composite image sequence that require enhancement.&quot;,

Complete syntax checking and most semantic analysis is performed as the program is entered and as it is subsequently edited. Analysis is performed character by character. The most remarkable feature of CAPS is its ability to automatically diagnose errors both at compile time and at run time. Errors are not automatically corrected. Instead, CAPS interacts with the student to help him find the cause of his error. Most components of CAPS are table driven, both to reduce the space needed for implementation and to increase the flexibility of the multilingual system. Over 500 students have used CAPS to learn Fortran, PL/I, or Cobol in conjunction with a computer assisted course on introductory computer science.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;This roster contains a list of 167 currently existing higher-level languages which have been developed or reported in the United States; have been implemented on at least one general-purpose computer; and are believed to be in use in the United States by someone other than the developer. A programming ( equals higher-level) language is defined as a set of characters and rules for combining them which has the following characteristics: the language requires no knowledge of machine code by the user; the language is significantly independent of a particular computer; there is a one-many translation of instructions from source code to object code; and the notation of the language is fairly natural to its problem area and is not a fixed tabular format. Of the total of 167 languages, 79 are in categories: numerical scientific, business data processing, list processing, string processing, formula manipulation, and multipurpose. The remaining 88 are in various specialized application areas.&quot;,

There are four major components: Problem Statement Language, Problem Statement Analyzer, Generator of Alternative Designs, and Performance Evaluator. The statement of requirements was written in ADS (Accurately Defined Systems) and analyzed by a Problem Statement Analyzer for ADS. The analyzed problem statement was translated to the form necessary for use by the SODA (Systems Optimization and Design Algorithm) program for the generation of alternative specifications of program modules and logical database structures.&quot;,

The syntax-driven waveform analysis system has been applied with good results to these pulse waves to detect and measure structural variations. The waveform applied with good results to these pulse waves to detect and measure structural variations. The waveform parsing system is modeled on a compiler-compiler system and allows the user to enter application specific information as data. It is thus general enough to be applicable to other waveforms.&quot;,

The file system uses one or more storage devices, and each record may be partitioned into subrecords that are stored on different devices. One of the subrecords is designated as the primary record; when a request for a record is made, the primary record is first accessed, and other subrecords are accessed only if the pertinent information is not stored in the primary record. The model that is presented in this paper, both as a nonlinear programming model and a mixed integer programming model, is a very general one; several types of file systems may be derived from it by an appropriate selection of its parameters. This model has already been used in the optimization of library routines' storage at a large scale operating system.&quot;,

Finally, it is supposed that the problem involves the detection of a large number of combined occurrences for a large number of changes of values of variables. Two efficient solutions for this problem are described. Both methods have the unusual property of being faster for systems where the sum p//1 plus\ldots{} plus p//n is larger.

Since any convex hull algorithm requires at least O(n log n) operations, the time complexity of the proposed algorithms is optimal within a multiplicative constant.&quot;,

Use of these statistics is appropriate if the contents of the working set at the start of the recorded string are unknown. If a certain stationarity condition holds, these statistics provide unbiased estimates of expected working-set sizes, missing-page probabilities, and interference distance probabilities. Two other pairs of estimators are shown to be biased. Expressions for the transient-free statistics are obtained in terms of interval statistics. Methods are described for handling long strings containing many distinct page names.&quot;,

In attempting to solve these linear programming models, using IBM's MPS package, instances of cycling were encountered. Small perturbations in the input data resulted in problems which did not cycle. This fact, plus several other observed phenomena suggest that the primary reason that cycling is not known to occur more frequently is that round-off errors in the computations perturb the problem sufficiently to prevent cycling (or at least to prevent indefinite cycling).&quot;,

Shadow buckets in the key search sequence reduce the effect of nonuniformity in file loading, and decrease the number of maximum probes needed to locate a record.

The concept of a register life is in troduced, and used to answer questions like: How many registers are used simultaneously? How many would be sufficient all of the time? Most of the time? What would the overhead be if the number of registers were reduced? What are registers used for during their lives? The paper also discusses the problem of detecting desirable but non-existing instructions. Other problems are briefly discussed. Experimental results are presented, obtained by analyzing 41 programs running on the DEC system 10 ISP.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;Precedence tables and linear precedence functions have been used and extensively studied as aids for syntax-directed compiling. If a precedence table exists but cannot be reshaped into a pair of precedence functions, several techniques for eliminating blank entries may be used. In that case, all nonblank entries have to be kept, however. Thus, there is a considerable gap between the storage requirements of precedence functions and precedence tables. The purpose of this paper is to show that the gap between precedence functions and precedence tables can be closed in a natural way.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;A proof method, subgoal induction, is presented as an alternative or supplement to the commonly used inductive assertion method. Its major virtue is that it can often be used to prove a loop's correctness directly from its input-output specification without the use of an invariant. The relation between subgoal induction and other commonly used induction rules is explored and, in particular, it is shown that subgoal induction can be viewed as a specialized form of computation induction.&quot;,

This paper describes a nonsemantic editing scheme which performs eliminations on the basis of local properties of the region adjacency graph. The scheme is based on definitions of graph properties which are satisfied when a spurious region is present; then editing is equivalent to fast graph operations. A number of examples are shown.&quot;,

The average cost of retrieving entries from these indexes is expressed as a weighted sum of the cost of a basic key comparison and the cost of crossing a page boundary in the index structure. Formulas for the retrieval costs for possible combinations of design alternatives are given.&quot;,

However, the results do not invalidate the concept of a stage model. The analysis suggests an alternative model of budget growth and a separation between models of budgeting growth and growth stages in the development of the computer resource.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;This paper extends the use of the regenerative property of queueing systems in the analysis of simulation output. In particular, it describes a sequential estimation method which when used with the regenerative property allows results to be obtained with specified statistical accuracy. This method includes a test to check the normality assumption on which the sequential procedure relies. The paper illustrates the method using the empty and idle state as the regenerative state. A second example then describes how using the most frequently entered state as the regenerative state reduces the chance of making a costly error in a preliminary simulation run. The paper also described how a variance reduction method due to Page [9] can be used to obtain a specified accuracy with considerably fewer job completions than are required when no variance reduction technique is applied.&quot;,

The criteria for comparison encompass theoretical aspects (e.g. path lengths) and implementation independent and machine/algorithm-dependent measures (e.g. run time). A detailed analysis of code is also presented at a level believed to be language-and compiler-independent. The quality of the resulting trees and the overhead spent on building them are analyzed, and some guidelines are given for an efficient use of the methods. If insertion and subsequent queries are the only operations of in terest, then ``pure'' AVL trees present the overall best qualities.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;Abstract data types can play a significant role in the development of software that is reliable, efficient, and flexible. This paper presents and discusses the application of an algebraic technique for the specification of abstract data types. Among the examples presented is a top-down development of a symbol table for a block structured language; a discussion of the proof of its correctness is given. A brief discussion of the problems involved in constructing algebraic specifications that are both consistent and complete is also provided.&quot;,

A top-down methodology for database design is described which separates decisions concerning aggregate structure from decisions concerning key identification. It is suggested that aggregate types, and other types which support real-world abstractions without introducing implementation detail, should be incorporated into programming languages.&quot;,

The distinctive feature of this algorithm is a technique for traversing the structure twice, using the same spanning tree in each case, first from left to right and then from right to left.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;This paper presents a scheme for classifying scheduling algorithms based on an abstract model of a scheduling system which formalizes the notion of priority. Various classes of scheduling algorithms are defined and related to existing algorithms. A criterion for the implementation efficiency of an algorithm is developed and results in the definition of time-invariant algorithms, which include most of the commonly implemented ones. For time-invariant algorithms, the dependence of processing rates on priorities is derived. The abstract model provides a framework for implementing flexible schedulers in real operating systems. The policy-driven scheduler of Bernstein and Sharp is discussed as an example of such an implementation.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;In the monitor concept, as proposed by Brinch Hansen and Hoare, event queues are used for synchronization. This paper describes another synchronizing primitive which is nearly as expressive as the conditional wait, but can be implemented more efficiently. An implementation of this primitive in terms of P and V operations is given together with a correctness proof. Two examples are presented: the readers and writers problem and the problem of information streams sharing a finite buffer pool.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;An information flow policy specifies a set of security classes for information, a flow relation defining permissible flows among these classes, and a method of binding each storage object to some class. This paper presents a compile-time mechanism that certifies a program only if it specifies no flows in violation of the flow policy. Because it exploits the properties of a lattice structure among security classes, the procedure is sufficiently simple that it can easily be included in the analysis phase of most existing compilers. Appropriate semantics are presented and proved correct. An important application is the confinement problem. The mechanism can prove that a program cannot cause supposedly nonconfidential results to depend on confidential input data.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;Lucid is a formal system in which programs can be written and proofs of programs carried out. The proofs are particularly easy to follow and straight-forward to produce because the statements in a Lucid program are simply axioms from which the proof proceeds by (almost) conventional logic reasoning, with the help of a few axioms and rules of inference for the special lucid functions. As a programming language, Lucid is unconventional because, among other things, the order of statements is irrelevant and assignment statements are equations. Nevertheless, Lucid programs need not look much different than iterative programs in a conventional structured programming language using assignment and conditional statements and loops.&quot;,

This paper describes an alternative approach in which SNOBOL4 patterns are compiled into Algol functions, which can be combined into larger (more complicated) patterns, and which are directly executed. It was developed as part of the implementation of ``Snobal\slash 67'', a Burroughs B6700 compiler for a SNOBAL4-like language.&quot;,

In this paper the abstraction techniques are extended from simple data representation and function definition to the iteration statement, the most important point of interaction between data and the control structure of the language itself. A means of specializing Alphard's loops to operate on abstract entities without explicit dependence on the representation of those entities is in troduced. \par Specification and verification techniques that allow the properties of the generators for such iterations to be expressed in the form of proof rules are developed. \par Results are obtained that for common special cases of these loops are essentially identical to the corresponding constructs in other languages. A means of showing that a generator will terminate is also provided.&quot;,

Work in programming methodology has led to the realization that three kinds of abstractions --- procedural, control, and especially data abstractions --- are useful in the programming process. Of these, only the procedural abstraction is supported well by conventional languages, through the procedure or subroutine. CLU provides, in addition to procedures, novel linguistic mechanisms that support the use of data and control abstractions. This paper provides an introduction to the abstractions mechanisms in CLU.&quot;,

This may be the only practical way to make real-time systems analytically verifiable and ultimately reliable. A possible discipline is outlined and expressed in terms of the language Modula.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;Logic has been long interested in whether answers to certain questions are computable in principle, since the outcome puts bounds on the possibilities of formalization. It would seem that the understanding of higher-level program features involves one with infinite objects and forces one to pass through several levels of explanation to go from the conceptual ideas to the final simulation on a real machine. These levels can be made mathematically exact if the right abstractions can be found to represent the necessary structures. In this paper, the author outlines his approach to these problems, specifically his lambda -calculus orientation.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;An optimization technique known as inline substitution is analyzed. The optimization consists of replacing a procedure invocation by a modified copy of the procedure body. The general problem of using inline substitution to minimize execution time subject to size constraints is formulated, and an approximate algorithmic solution is proposed. The algorithm depends on run-time statistics about the program to be optimized. Preliminary results for the CLU structured programming language indicate that, in programs with a low degree of recursion, over 90 percent of all procedure calls can be eliminated, with little increase in the size of compiled code and a small savings in execution time.&quot;,

The additional hardware required for this estimate to be computed consists of a program accessible register containing the miss rate of the associative memory used for page table words. This primary memory requirement estimate was employed in an experimental version of Multics to control the level of multiprogramming in the system and to bill for memory usage. The resulting system's tuning parameters display configuration insensitivity, and it is conjectured that the system would also track shifts in the referencing characteristics of its workload and keep the system in tune.&quot;,

A modified sieve of Eratosthenes using doubly linked lists yields an algorithm of O//A(N) arithmetic complexity. This upper bound is shown to be equivalent to the theoretical lower bound for sieve methods without preprocessing. Use of preprocessing techniques involving space-time and additive-multiplicative tradeoffs reduces this upper bound to O//A(N/log logN) and the bit complexity to O//B(N logN log log logN). A storage requirement is described using O//B(N logN\slash log logN) bits as well.&quot;,

This surface, to be composed of triangular tiles, is constructed by separately determining an optimal surface between each pair of consecutive contours. Determining such a surface is reduced to the problem of finding certain minimum cost cycles in a directed toroidal graph. A new fast algorithm for finding such cycles is utilized. Also developed is a closed-form expression, in terms of the number of contour points, for an upper bound on the number of operations required to execute the algorithm. An illustrated example which involves the construction of a minimum area surface describing a human head is included.&quot;,

The method is a synthesis of spline theory and algorithms, an interactive means for man-machine communication, and software for static or dynamic graphics display. The basic technique employed is a modified lofting method in which sectional curves are represented by uniform B-splines and the surface is interpolated between sections by Cardinal splines. Among the features of this method are algorithms which enable interactive modification of the B-spline representation of the sectional curves. At all stages of the process, the spatial information is graphically displayed to the user. Complex surfaces can be created by the combination of a number of shapes that have been separately generated and automatically joined. The system has been successfully interfaced to a variety of analytical routines for structural, medical and graphical applications.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;In contrast to the predominant use of low-level in termediate text, high-level data flow analysis deals with programs essentially at source level and exploits the control flow information implicit in the parse tree. The need for high-level flow analysis arises from several aspects of recent work on advanced methods of program certification and optimization. \par This paper proposes a simple general method of high-level data flow analysis that allows free use of escape and jump statements, avoids large graphs when compiling large programs, facilitates updating of data flow information to reflect program changes, and derives new global information helpful in solving many familiar global flow analysis problems. An illustrative application to live variable analysis is presented. \par Many of the graphs involved are constructed and analyzed before any programs are compiled, thus avoiding certain costs that low-level methods incur repeatedly at compile time.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;The basic ideas of nondeterministic programming are critically reconsidered to single out a proper attitude and programming style for languages allowing direct control of nondeterministic features. The proposed attitude aims at retaining the purity of the nondeterministic formulation of search processes on one level (the attempt level), deferring the coordination of problem solving efforts to another (the choice level). The feasibility of recognizing these two levels is discussed, stressing that the structure to be managed at the choice level is a tree of contexts. The leaves are computational environments, each holding an alternative under inspection, while the other nodes are associated with choice points. According to the proposed programming style, a generative function is associated with each choice point, which expresses the desired choice strategy. The main advantage of this approach is the localization of the search strategies: Each nonterminal node of the tree keeps track of the state of the computation as it was when the choice point was last interrogated, holding at the same time the strategy to coordinate the available alternatives. Examples are given in term of ND-Lisp, an extension of Lisp designed and implemented according to these guidelines.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;Regular right part (RRP) grammars, which resemble PASCAL syntax diagrams, describe the syntax of programming languages more concisely and more understandably than is possible with CF grammars. Also introduced is a class of parsers, RRP LR(m, k) parsers, which includes the CF LR(k) parsers and provides the same advantages. Informally, an RRP LR(m, k) parser can determine the right end of each handle by considering at most k symbols to the right of the handle and the left end, after the right end has been found, by considering at most m symbols to the left of the handle. A mechanism for determining the left end is required because there is no bound on the length of the handle.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;The deadlock avoidance problem may be defined informally as the determination, from some a priori information about the processes, resources, operating system, etc., of the ``safe situations'' which may be realized without endangering the smooth running of the system. When each process specifies its future needs by a flowchart of need-defined steps, a global approach to the phenomenon and its interpretation as a game between the operating system and the processes allows formalization of risk and safety concepts. The bipartite graph representation of this game may then be used to construct explicitly the set of safe states and to study their properties.&quot;,

Home memory organization is shown to be particularly suited to certain specialized computational problems as well as to possess advantages in terms of interference and reliability for general purpose computation. Results for interleaved memory are drawn from previous work and are used for comparison. Trace-driven simulations are used to verify the conclusions of the analysis.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;An algorithm is presented that searches for the location, ``i,'' of the first occurrence of a character string, ``pat,'' in another string, ``string.'' During the search operation, the characters of pat are matched starting with the last character of pat. The information gained by starting the match at the end of the pattern often allows the algorithm to proceed in large jumps through the text being searched. Thus the algorithm has the unusual property that, in most cases, not all of the first i characters of string are inspected. The number of characters actually inspected (on the average) decreases as a function of the length of pat. For a random English pattern of length 5, the algorithm will typically inspect i/4 characters of string before finding a match at i. Furthermore, the algorithm has been implemented so that (on the average) fewer than i plus patlen machine instructions are executed. These conclusions are supported with empirical evidence and a theoretical analysis of the average behavior of the algorithm. The worst case behavior of the algorithm is linear in i plus patlen, assuming the availability of array space for tables linear in patlen plus the size of the alphabet.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;Simulation data are reported showing that, in dynamic memory allocation, the average free-to-allocated-block ratio can differ considerably and in both directions from the predictions of the 50 percent rule. A new derivation is given, and it is shown that previous derivations make an assumption that may be violated frequently. On the basis of the simulation data and the derivation, it is hypothesized that the anomalous behavior results from the combined effects of systematic placement and the statistics of the release process. Additional simulations support this hypothesis. Systematic placement, which refers to the natural convention of always allocating storage requests against the same end of the free block selected by the allocation strategy, tends to order blocks within contiguous groups, according to their allocation time. The degree of anomalous behavior depends on the extent to which allocated blocks are released in the order of their allocation. For non-Markovian release processes, the extent of the correlation between allocation order and release order varies approximately inversely with the coefficient of variation of the memory residence time distribution. The simulations show that allocation efficiency depends strongly on the residence time distribution; efficiency decreases as the distribution's coefficient of variation increases. Some practical implications are briefly discussed.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;A refinement of hashing which allows retrieval of an item in a static table with a single probe is considered. Given a set I of identifiers, two methods are presented for building, in a mechanical way, perfect hashing functions, i.e. functions transforming the elements of I into unique addresses. The first method, the ``quotient reduction'' method, is shown to be complete in the sense that for every set I the smallest table in which the elements of I can be stored and from which they can be retrieved by using a perfect hashing function constructed by this method can be found. However, for nonuniformly distributed sets, this method can give rather sparse tables. The second method, the ``remainder reduction'' method, is not complete in the above sense, but it seems to give minimal (or almost minimal) tables for every kind of set. The two techniques are applicable directly to small sets. Some methods to extend these results to larger sets are also presented. A rough comparison with ordinary hashing is given which shows that this method can be used conveniently in several practical applications.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;A new technique of program transformation, called ``recursion introduction,'' is described and applied to two algorithms which solve pattern matching problems. By using a recursion introduction, algorithms which manipulate a stack are first translated into recursive algorithms in which no stack operations occur. These algorithms are then subjected to a second transformation, a method of recursion elimination called ``tabulation,'' to produce programs with a very efficient running time. In particular, it is shown how the fast linear pattern matching algorithm of Knuth, Morris, and Pratt can be derived in a few steps from a simple nonlinear stack algorithm.&quot;,

Algorithm performance was measured in terms of processing time, memory usage, and external memory fragmentation. Algorithms maintaining separate free space lists for each size of memory block used tended to perform quite well compared with other algorithms. Simple algorithms operating on memory ordered lists (without any free list) performed surprisingly well. Algorithms employing power-of-two block sizes had favorable processing requirements but generally unfavorable memory usage. Algorithms employing LIFO, FIFO, or memory ordered free lists generally performed poorly compared with others.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;The efficient retrieval from a database of records that satisfy an expression involving more than one data field is examined. Sequences of character strings with an order relation imposed between sequences are considered. An encoding scheme is described which produces a single, order-preserving string from a sequence of strings. The original sequence can be recovered from the encoded string, and one sequence of strings precedes another if and only if the encoding of the first precedes the encoding of the second. The strings may be variable length, without a maximum length restriction, and no symbols need be reserved for control purposes. Hence any symbol may occur in any string. The scheme is useful for multifield sorting, multifield indexing, and other applications where ordering on more than one field is important.&quot;,

This has two important consequences: (1) Couriers or other secure means are not needed to transmit keys, since a message can be enciphered using an encryption key publicly revealed by the intended recipient. (2) A message can be ``signed'' using a privately held decryption key. Anyone can verify this signature using the corresponding publicly revealed encryption key. Signatures cannot be forged, and a signer cannot later deny the validity of his signature.&quot;,

The aim is to demonstrate systematic recursion-removal techniques on something more complex than Knuth's ``sturdy toddler'' and to obtain measurements of the cost of procedure linkage in PL/I and the savings achievable via procedure integration in the presence of recursion. First, the paper describes the recursion-removal process and the example on which it will be illustrated. Recursion removal is then applied to the two major parts of this example and the final result of the process is displayed. Our performance comparison results are presented and our conclusions are briefly discussed.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;E. Kellerman has presented a method for determining keyword conflicts and described a heuristic algorithm which solves a certain combinatorial optimization problem in connection with this method. This optimization problem is shown to be equivalent to the problem of covering the edges of a graph by complete subgraphs with the objective of minimizing the number of complete subgraphs. A relationship between this edge-clique-cover problem and the graph coloring problem is established which allows algorithms for either one of these problems to be constructed from algorithms for the other.&quot;,

Under the same assumptions, for a system of linear equations, the relaxation method converges to the minimum norm solution. Previously proposed techniques are shown to be special cases of our procedure with different choices of relaxation parameters. The practical consequences for image reconstruction of the choice of the relaxation parameters are discussed. This work is applicable to biomedical engineering and mathematical programming.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;This paper explores a technique for proving the correctness and termination of programs simultaneously. \par This approach, the intermittent-assertion method, involves documenting the program with assertions that must be true at some time when control passes through the corresponding point, but that need not be true every time. The method, introduced by Burstall, promises to provide a valuable complement to the more conventional methods. The intermittent-assertion method is presented with a number of examples of correctness and termination proofs. Some of these proofs are markedly simpler than their conventional counterparts. \par On the other hand, it is shown that a proof of correctness or termination by any of the conventional techniques can be rephrased directly as a proof using intermittent assertions. Finally, it is shown how the intermittent-assertion method can be applied to prove the validity of program transformations and the correctness of continuously operating programs.&quot;,

The second uses the difference between the mean and median gray levels in a neighborhood. The outputs obtained from these operators applied to a set of test pictures are compared with each other and with the standard digital Laplacian and gradient. A third operator, which uses the distance between the center and centroid of a neighborhood as an edge value, is also briefly considered; it turns out to be equivalent to one of the standard digital approximations to the gradient.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;Programmers and data structure designers are often forced to choose between alternative structures. \par In storing these structures, preserving logical adjacencies or ``proximity'' is usually an important consideration. \par The combinatorial problem of storing arrays as various kinds of list structures is examined. Embeddings of graphs are used to model the loss of proximity involved in such storage schemes, and an elementary proof that arrays cannot be stored as linear lists with bounded loss of proximity is presented. Average loss of proximity is then considered, and it is shown that arrays cannot be stored as linear lists with only bounded loss of average proximity, but can be so stored in binary trees. The former result implies, for instance, that row major order is an asymptotically optimal storage strategy for arrays.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;Five types of anomalous behavior which may occur in paged virtual memory operating systems are defined. One type of anomaly, for example, concerns the fact that, with certain reference strings and paging algorithms, an increase in mean memory allocation may result in an increase in fault rate. Two paging algorithms, the page fault frequency and working set algorithms, are examined in terms of their anomaly potential, and reference string examples of various anomalies are presented. Two paging algorithm properties, the inclusion property and the generalized inclusion property, are discussed and the anomaly implications of these properties presented.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;Based on an empirical study of more than 10,000 lines of program text written in a GOTO-less language, a machine architecture specifically designed for structured programs is proposed. Since assignment, CALL, RETURN, and IF statements together account for 93 percent of all executable statements, special care is given to ensure that these statements can be implemented efficiently. A highly compact instruction encoding scheme is presented, which can reduce program size by a factor of 3. Unlike a Huffman code, which utilizes variable length fields, this method uses only fixed length (1-byte) op code and address fields. The most frequent instructions consist of a single 1-byte field. As a consequence, instruction decoding time is minimized, and the machine is efficient with respect to both space and time.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;Nonsingular binary matrices of order N, i.e., nonsingular over the field left brace 0,1 right brace, and an initial segment of the natural numbers are placed in one-to-one correspondence. Each natural number corresponds to two intermediate vectors. These vectors are mapped into a nonsingular binary matrix. Examples of complete enumeration of all 2 multiplied by 2 and 3 multiplied by 3 nonsingular binary matrices were produced by mapping the intermediate vectors to the matrices. The mapping has application to the Vernam encipherment method using pseudorandom number sequences. A bit string formed from bytes of text of a data encryption key can be used as a representation of a natural number. This natural number is transformed to a nonsingular binary matrix. Key leverage is obtained by using the matrix as a ``seed'' in a shift register sequence pseudorandom number generator.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;A simple algorithm is described for isolating the differences between two files. One application is the comparing of two versions of a source program or other file in order to display all differences. The algorithm isolates differences in a way that corresponds closely to our intuitive notion of difference, is easy to implement, and is computationally efficient, with time linear in the file length. For most applications the algorithm isolates differences similar to those isolated by the longest common subsequence. Another application of this algorithm merges files containing independently generated changes into a single file. The algorithm can also be used to generate efficient encodings of a file in the form of the differences between itself and a given ``datum'' file, permitting reconstruction of the original file from the difference and datum files.&quot;,

Classical implementations of list processing systems lack this property because allocating a list cell from the heap may cause a garbage collection, which process requires time proportional to the heap size to finish. A real-time list processing system is presented which continuously reclaims garbage, including directed cycles, while linearizing and compacting the accessible cells into contiguous locations to avoid fragmenting the free storage pool.&quot;,

This paper shows that it is possible to select a key over open communications channels in such a fashion that communications security can be maintained. A method is described which forces any enemy to expend an amount of work which increases as the square of the work required of the two communicants to select the key. The method provides a logically new kind of protection against the passive eaves dropper. It suggests that further research on this topic will be highly rewarding, both in a theoretical and a practical sense.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;An algorithm is presented for copying an arbitrarily linked list structure into a block of contiguous storage locations without destroying the original list. Apart from a fixed number of program variables, no auxiliary storage, such as a stack, is used. The algorithm needs no mark bits and operates in linear time. It is shown to be significantly faster than Fisher's algorithm, the fastest previous linear-time algorithm for the same problem. Its speed comes mainly from its efficient list-traversal technique, which folds the processing stack into the structure being built, and from its classification of list cells into nine types, which enables processing operations to be optimized for each type.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;Controlled sharing of information is needed and desirable for many applications and is supported in operating systems by access control mechanisms. This work shows how to extend programming languages to provide controlled sharing. The extension permits expression of access constraints on shared data. Access constraints can apply both to simple objects, and to objects that are components of larger objects, such as bank account records in a bank's data base. The approach can be used to extend any strongly-typed language, but is particularly suitable for extending languages that support the notion of abstract data types.&quot;,

A technique is introduced whereby test data can be used in proving program correctness. In addition to simplifying the process of proving correctness, this method simplifies the process of providing accurate specification for a program. The applicability of this technique to procedures and recursive programs is demonstrated.&quot;,

In addition, argument binding is under the control of the programmer, permitting the definition of various methods of argument transmission in the source language itself. The resulting procedure mechanism, which is part of the SL5 programming language, is well suited to goal-oriented problems and to other problems that are more readily programmed by using coroutines. Several examples are given.&quot;,

The core storage requirements and programming effort for this method are similar to those of Fishman's method. The proposed method is the same as Fishman's method for 1 less than equivalent to alpha less than 2 and is faster than Fishman's method for 3 less than equivalent to alpha less than equivalent to 19.

For a ratio of 100:1, 10\slash 11 of a full cycle should be covered quickly and 1/11 should be covered slowly. As device manufacturers increase this ratio, the average latency for a block transfer will slowly decrease. Increasing the raw shift speed will of course directly reduce both the latency time and the block transfer time.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;A one-sided height-balanced tree is a binary tree in which every mode's right subtree has a height which is equal to or exactly one greater than the height of its left subtree. It has an advantage over the more general AVL tree in that only one bit of balancing information is required (two bits are required for the AVL tree). It is shown that deletion of an arbitrary node of such a tree can be accomplished in O(log n) operations, where n is the number of nodes in the tree. Moreover the method is optimal in the sense that its complexity cannot be reduced in order of magnitude. This result, coupled with earlier results by D. S. Hirschberg, indicates that, of the three basic problems of insertion, deletion, and retrieval, only insertion is adversely affected by this modification of an AVL tree.&quot;,

The variables in these formulas represent not only the length of the input string but also the time to perform elementary operations such as pushing, popping, subscripting, iterating, etc. By binding to the variables actual numerical values corresponding to a given compiler-machine configuration, one can determine the execution time for that configuration. Time-formulas are derived by examining the grammar rules and the program representing the algorithm one wishes to analyze. The approach is described by using a specific grammar that defines simple arithmetic expressions.&quot;,

To analyze the problems in this area a questionnaire was developed and pretested. It was then submitted to 120 organizations. Respondents totaled 69.

The fifteen program characteristics hypothesized as being associated with an increase in programming time required are objectively measurable from preprogramming specifications. The five programmer characteristics are experience-related and are also measurable before a programming task is begun. Nine program characteristics emerged as major influences on program development time, each associated with increased program development time. All five programmer characteristics are found to be related to reduced program development time.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;Shallow binding is a scheme which allows the value of a variable to be accessed in a bounded amount of computation. An elegant model for shallow binding in Lisp 1.5 is presented in which context-switching is an environment tree transformation called rerooting. Rerooting is completely general and reversible, and is optional in the sense that a Lisp 1.5 interpreter will operate correctly whether or not rerooting is invoked on every context change. Since rerooting leaves assoc left bracket v, a right bracket invariant, for all variables v and all environments a, the programmer can have access to a rerooting primitive, shallow left bracket right bracket, which gives him dynamic control over whether accesses are shallow or deep, and which affects only the speed of execution of a program, not its semantics.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;A system for proving that programs written in a high level language are correctly translated to a low level language is described. A primary use of the system is as a postoptimization step in code generation. The low level language programs need not be generated by a compiler and in fact could be hand coded. Examples of the usefulness of such a system are given. Some interesting results are the ability to handle programs that implement recursion by bypassing the start of the program, and the detection and pinpointing of a wide class of errors in the low level language programs. The examples demonstrate that optimization of the genre of this paper can result in a substantially faster operation and the saving of memory in terms of program and stack sizes.&quot;,

Since many physical systems can be modeled by Markov and semi-Markov processes, the potential range of application of these techniques is much wider than the problem of availability analyzed.&quot;,

Inherent defects at the most basic level cause them to be both fat and weak: their primitive word-at-a-time style of programming inherited from their common ancestor, the von Neumann computer; their division of programming into a world of expressions and a world of statements; their inability to effectively use powerful combining forms for building new programs from existing ones; and their lack of useful mathematical properties for reasoning about programs. An alternative functional style of programming is founded on the use of combining forms for creating programs. Functional programs deal with structured data, are often nonrepetitive and nonrecursive, are hierarchically constructed, do not name their arguments, and do not require the complex machinery of procedure declarations to become generally applicable. Combining forms can use high level programs to build still higher level ones in a style not possible in conventional languages.&quot;,

The model systems feature simulated continuous-flow and preempt-resume scheduling of input-output activity. Attention is given to the amount of memory resource required for effective processing of the I/O activity (buffer space assignment). The model studies used both distribution-driven and trace-driven techniques. Even relatively simple dynamic schedulers are shown to improve system performance (as measured by user CPU time) over that given by optimal or near-optimal static schedulers imbedded in identical system structures and workload environments. The improvement is greatest under a heavy I/O demand workload.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;A description is given of the structure and operation of a hybrid simulation model in which both discrete-event simulation and analytic techniques are combined to produce efficient yet accurate system models. In an example based on a simple hypothetical computer system, discrete-event simulation is used to model the arrival and activation of jobs, and a central-server queueing network models the use of system processors. The accuracy and efficiency of the hybrid technique are demonstrated by comparing the result and computational costs of the hybrid model of the example with those of an equivalent simulation-only model.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;A new interprocedural data flow analysis algorithm is presented and analyzed. The algorithm associates with each procedure in a program information about which variables may be modified, which may be used, and which are possibly preserved by a call on the procedure, and all of its subcalls. The algorithm is sufficiently powerful to be used on recursive programs and to deal with the sharing of variables which arises through reference parameters. The algorithm is unique in that it can compute all of this information in a single pass, not requiring a prepass to compute calling relationships or sharing patterns. The algorithm is asymptotically optimal in time complexity. It has been implemented and is practical even on programs which are quite large.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;The working-set concept is extended for programs that reference segments of different sizes. The generalized working-set policy (GWS) keeps as its resident set those segments whose retention costs do not exceed their retrieval costs. The GWS is a model for the entire class of demand-fetching memory policies that satisfy a resident-set inclusion property. A generalized optimal policy (GOPT) is also defined; at its operating points it minimizes aggregated retention and swapping costs. Special cases of the cost structure allow GWS and GOPT to simulate any known stack algorithm, the working set, and VMIN. Efficient procedures for computing demand curves showing swapping load as a function of memory usage are developed for GWS and GOPT policies. Empirical data from an actual system are included.&quot;,

The second part deals with the less apparent problem of providing efficiency and flexibility as scheduled events are accessed to be executed. Additional features and problems dealt with include the proper handling of simultaneous events; that certain events must be created, scheduled, and executed at the same points in simulated time; that infinite loops caused by the concatenation of such ``zero-time'' events are possible and must be diagnosed; that maintaining various event counts is practical and economical; and that a capability for handling ``time-displaceable'' events is desirable and possible.&quot;,

The method described runs in real time in the sense that the computation required per output character is constant. While the contours produced exhibit local inaccuracies, they retain the properties of not crossing and of forming closed curves (except where they intersect the boundaries of the map).&quot;,

In several cases, such as DO loops (due to deletion of extended range) and IF blocks, it should be possible to generate even more efficient code than before.

The objective is to find a transformed digital picture of a given picture such that the sum of absolute errors between the gray level histogram of the transformed picture and that of a reference picture is minimized. This is equivalent to placing k1 linearly ordered objects of different sizes one by one into k2 linearly ordered boxes of assorted sizes, such that the accumulated error of space underpacked or overpacked in the boxes is minimized; the placement function is monotonic, which ensures a polynomial time solution to this problem. A tree search algorithm for optimal histogram matching is presented which has time complexity O(k1 multiplied by k2). If the monotone property is dropped, then the problem becomes NP-complete, even if it is restricted to k2 equals 2.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;Scatter tables for open addressing benefit from recursive entry displacements, cutoffs for unsuccessful searches, and auxiliary cost functions. Compared with conventional methods, the new techniques provide substantially improved tables that resemble exact-solution optimal packings. The displacements are depth-limited approximations to an enumerative (exhaustive) optimization, although packing costs remain linear --- O(n) --- with table size n. The techniques are primarily suited for important fixed (but possibly quite large) tables for which reference frequencies may be known: op-code tables, spelling dictionaries, access arrays. Introduction of frequency weights further improves retrievals, but the enhancement may degrade cutoffs.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;In a two-level computer storage hierarchy, miss ratio measurements are often made from a ``cold start'', that is, made with the first-level store initially empty. For large capacities the effect on the measured miss ratio of the misses incurred while filling the first-level store can be significant, even for long reference strings. Use of ``warm-start'' rather than ``cold-start'' miss ratios cast doubt on the widespread belief that the observed ``S-shape'' of lifetime (reciprocal of miss ratio) versus capacity curve indicates a property of behavior of programs that maintain a constant number of pages in main storage. It is shown how to obtain, under simple assumptions, the cache miss ratio for multiprogramming from cold-start miss ratio values and how to obtain approximate cold-start miss ratios from warm-start miss ratios.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;SEMBEGS is a complete batch environment graphical system containing components for handling graphical data files, for displaying the contents files on a variety of graphical hardware, and for performing graphical batch input operations. SEMBERG is easy to extend and modify to meet the growing needs of a large batch environment, and is even extendable to a fully interactive system. The paper presents the conceptual view of graphics leading to the design of SEMBEGS and outlines the major components of the system. The design of SEMBEGS is founded upon the basic assumption that the true aim of computer graphics is to describe graphical entities, rather than, as commonly held, to provide graphical input and output functional capabilities. SEMBEGS is built around a Basic Graphical Data Management System (BAGDAMS) which provides a common means of communicating the descriptions of graphical entities between the various components of SEMBEGS. BAGDAMS provides facilities for storing, retrieving, and manipulating the descriptions of graphical entities provided by, and received by application programs, graphics packages, and graphical devices.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;Simulation is presented as a practical technique for performance evaluation of alternative configurations of highly concurrent computers. A technique is described for constructing a detailed deterministic simulation model of a system. In the model a control stream replaces the instruction and data streams of the real system. Simulation of the system model yields the timing resource usage statistics needed for performance evaluation, without the necessity of emulating the system. As a case study, the implementation of a simulation of a model of the CPU-memory subsystem of the IBM 360\slash 191 is described. The results of evaluating some alternative system designs are discussed. The experiments reveal that, for the case study, the major bottlenecks in the system are the memory unit and the fixed point unit. Further, it appears that many of the sophisticated pipelining and buffering techniques implemented in the architecture of the IBM 360\slash 91 are of little value when high-speed (cache) memory is used, as in the IBM 360\slash 195.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;A number of image analysis tasks can benefit from registration of the image with a model of the surface being imaged. Automatic navigation using visible light or radar images requires exact alignment of such images with digital terrain models. In addition, automatic classification of terrain, using satellite imagery, requires such alignment to deal correctly with the effects of varying sun angle and surface slope. Even inspection techniques for certain industrial parts may be improved by this means. The required alignment is achieved by matching the real image with a synthetic image obtained from a surface model and known positions of the light sources. The synthetic image intensity is calculated using the reflectance map, a convenient way of describing surface reflection as a function of surface gradient. The technique is illustrated using LANDSAT images and digital terrain models.&quot;,

The number of nodes of a Pk tree asymptotically grows as a power of the height, in the worst case. A procedure for node insertion is given, and the class of trees considered is restricted to IPk trees, which are buildable by such a procedure. The average behavior of such trees, studied by an extensive set of simulation runs, is close to that of AVL trees. In particular, the family of IPO trees whose main advantage is the reduced number of restructurings required after node insertion, is analyzed.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;Split trees are a new technique for searching sets of keys with highly skewed frequency distributions. A split tree is a binary search tree each node of which contains two key values --- a node value which is a maximally frequent key in that subtree, and a split value which partitions the remaining keys (with respect to their lexical ordering) between the left and right subtrees. A median split tree (MST) uses the lexical median of a node's descendents as its split value to force the search tree to be perfectly balanced, achieving both a space efficient representation of the tree and high search speed. Unlike frequency ordered binary search trees, the cost of a successful search of an MST is log n bounded and very stable around minimal values. Further, an MST can be built for a given key ordering and set of frequencies in time n log n, as opposed to n**2 for an optimum binary search tree. A discussion of the application of MST's to dictionary lookup for English is presented, and the performance obtained is contrasted with that of other techniques.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;A new algorithm is presented for finding all primes between 2 and n. The algorithm executes in time proportional to n (assuming that multiplication of integers not larger than n can be performed in unit time). The method has the same arithmetic complexity as the algorithm presented by N. G. Mairson; however, this version is perhaps simpler and more elegant. It is also easily extended to find the prime factorization of all integers between 2 and n in time proportional to n.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;A new generation of computer terminals allows tab settings to be selected and set by the computer. This feature can be used to reduce the number of characters that are needed to represent a document for transmission and printing. An algorithm is given for selecting the optimal set of tab stops for minimizing the number of characters transmitted. An implementation of the algorithm has reduced the number of characters transmitted by from 7 to 30 percent, but requires a prepass through the document to compute a matrix used in determining the optimal set of tab stops. The use of fixed tab stops, as a heuristic alternative, can achieve about 80 percent of optimal with no prepass.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;Optimal decision table conversion has been tackled in the literature using two approaches, dynamic programming and branch-and-bound. The former technique is quite effective, but its time and space requirements are independent of how ``easy'' the given table is. Furthermore, it cannot be used to produce good, quasioptimal solutions The branch-and-bound technique uses a good heuristic to direct the search, but is cluttered up by an enormous search space, since the number of solutions increases with the number of test variables according to a double exponential. In this paper authors suggest a heuristically guided top-down search algorithm which, like dynamic programming, recognizes identical subproblems but which can be used to find both optimal and quasioptimal solutions. A heuristic search method is introduced that combines the positive aspects of the above two techniques. Compressed tables with a large number of variables can be handled without deriving expanded tables first.&quot;,

Algorithms for accomplishing this delivery through a store-and-forward packet switching computer network include (1) transmission of separately addressed packets, (2) multidestination addressing, (3) hot potato forwarding, (4) spanning tree forwarding, and (5) source based forwarding. To this list of algorithms is added (6) reverse path forwarding, a broadcast routing method which exploits routing procedures and data structures already available for packet switching. Reverse path forwarding is a practical algorithm for broadcast routing in store-and-forward packet switching computer networks. The algorithm is described as being practical because it is not optimal according to metrics developed for its analysis in this paper, and also because it can be implemented in existing networks with less complexity than that required for the known alternatives.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;A data abstraction can be naturally specified using algebraic axioms. The virtue of these axioms is that they permit a representation-independent formal specification of a data type. An example is given which shows how to employ algebraic axioms at successive levels of implementation. First, it is shown how the use of algebraic axiomatizations can simplify the process of proving the correctness of an implementation of an abstract data type. Second, semi-automatic tools are described which can be used both to automate such proofs of correctness and to derive an immediate implementation from the axioms. This implementation allows for limited testing of programs at design time, before a conventional implementation is accomplished.&quot;,

There are many potential interference problems in products made up of assemblies of components and in product manufacturing and testing. Typically, drawings are used in an attempt to detect such unwanted interferences, but the two-dimensional, static drafting medium does not always show interferences among three-dimensional, moving parts. A computer representation for solids and surfaces and algorithms which carry out interference checking among objects so represented are presented. Objects are represented as polyhedra or as piecewise planar surfaces. Two types of interference checking are discussed: detection of intersections among objects in fixed positions and detection of collisions among objects moving along specified trajectories.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;Due to the linear structure of source text, difficulties may arise in a one-pass compilation process. These difficulties occur when an entity cannot be processed because of a forward reference to information only obtainable from subsequent entities. Classic solutions ask for data structures appropriate for each case. A technique is presented which uses instead control structures, namely events and processes. The work of the compiler-writer becomes easier both conceptually and in practice because he can forget these problems at the outset and he avoids special processing for each problem. This technique has been applied to the construction of an Algol 68 compiler. Three examples from that implementation are described and discussed here.&quot;,

Combined with a small number of primitive semantic transforms, they provide a powerful tool for program manipulation. A complete catalogue of syntactic transforms, and its use for solution of a system of program equations, is given. Examples of derivation of more complex source to source transformations are also presented. Two case studies illustrate the way in which syntactic and semantic source to source transformations may be used for development of clear, simple, and reasonably efficient programs.&quot;,

Theorems exhibiting the relationships between the definitional systems are given and illustrated through graph representations. One of the approaches is used to define an APL array to be a recursive data structure equivalent to a tree structure in which all data is stored at the leaves as homogeneous arrays of numbers and characters. An extension of APL is proposed that includes new primitive functions to manipulate the nesting level of arrays and new operators to assist in the construction of data-driven algorithms.&quot;,

It is proposed to do both at once and to move each expression directly to the entrance of the outermost loop in which it is invariant. This is done by solving a more general problem, i.e. the elimination of computations performed twice on a given execution path. Such computations are termed partially redundant. Moreover, the algorithm does not require any graphical information or restrictions on the shape of the program graph. Testing this algorithm has shown that its execution cost is nearly linear with the size of the program, and that it leads to a smaller optimizer that requires less execution time.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;Synchronization of concurrent processes requires controlling the relative ordering of events in the processes. A new synchronization mechanism is proposed, using abstract objects called eventcounts and sequencers, that allows processes to control the ordering of events directly, rather than using mutual exclusion to protect manipulation of shared variables that control ordering of events. Direct control of ordering seems to simplify correctness arguments and also simplifies implementation in distributed systems. The mechanism is defined formally, and then several examples of its uses are given. The relationship of the mechanism to protection mechanisms in the system is explained; in particular, eventcounts are shown to be applicable to situations where confinement of information matters. An implementation of eventcounts and sequencers in a system with shared memory is described.&quot;,

The traditional methods find a hyperplane which separates all points in one class from all points in the other, but such a hyperplane is not necessarily centered in the empty space between the two classes. Since a central hyperplane does not favor one class or the other, it should have a lower error rate in classifying new points and is therefore better than a noncentral hyperplane. Six algorithms for finding central hyperplanes are tested on three data sets. Although frequently used in practice, the modified relaxation algorithm is very poor. Three algorithms which are defined in the paper are found to be quite good.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;An extended form of semantic network is defined, which can be regarded as a syntactic variant of the clausal form of logic. By virtue of its relationship with logic,the extended semantic network is provided with a precise semantics, inference rules, and a procedural interpretation. On the other hand, by regarding semantic networks as an abstract data structure for the representation of clauses, we provide a theorem-prover with a potentially useful indexing scheme and path-following strategy for guiding the search for a proof.&quot;,

Algorithms for the organization and retrieval of information are described. This method is particularly suitable for queries requesting a group of information items, all of which possess a particular set of attributes (and possibly some other attributes as well). Several examples are given; the results with respect to the number of disk accesses and disk space are compared to other common approaches. Algorithms evaluating the appropriateness of the above approach to a given information system are described. For a certain class of information systems, the normal multiplication table method yields far more rapid retrieval with a more economical space requirement than conventional systems. Moreover this method incorporates an improved modification of the inverted file technique.&quot;,

The search technique presented used the geometric structure of the pattern to define characteristics demanded of candidates for matching. This is useful in cases where the properties of each atom, considered individually, do not adequately limit the number of sets of possible matchings. Several applications of this technique in the field of chemistry are: (1) in pharmacology: Searching for a common constellation of atoms in molecules possessing similar biological activities; (2) in X-ray crystallography: fitting a structure or a structural fragment to a set of peaks in the electron-density distribution of a Fourier map; (3) in chemical documentation: retrieving from a file the structures containing specified substructures.&quot;,

Single measures of price-performance such as ``Grosch's Law'' are shown to be so oversimplified as to be meaningless. Multiple-regression models predicting system cost as a function of several hardware characteristics do, however, reveal a market dichotomy. On one hand there exists a stable, price predictable market for larger, general purpose computer systems. The other market is the developing one for small business computer systems, a market which is relatively unstable with low price predictability.&quot;,

The fundamental idea is to add a column (or row) analogous to adding an additional row of data in linear least squares problem. A column (or row) is dropped by a formal scaling with the imaginary unit, followed by least squares addition of the column (or row). The elimination process for the procedure is successive application of the Givens transformation in modified (more efficient) form. These ideas are illustrated with an implementation of the revised simplex method. The algorithm is a general purpose one that does not account for any particular structure or sparsity in the equations. Some suggested computational tests for determining signs of various controlling parameters in the revised simplex algorithm are mentioned. A simple means of constructing test cases and some sample computing times are presented.&quot;,

It uses a straightforward search technique to determine aggregations of computations, aggregations of datasets, device, organization, and key order for each dataset, key order for each computation, and access method for each dataset-computation pair. Although computational results are presented for a sample problem involving 54 computations and 49 datasets, the main point of the paper is that the underlying model works computationally and is simple enough to be adapted to many file design situations.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;As computer technology matures, our growing ability to create large systems is leading to basic changes in the nature of programming. Current programming language concepts will not be adequate for building and maintaining systems of the complexity called for by the tasks we attempt. Just as high level languages enabled the programmer to escape from the intricacies of a machine's order code, higher level programming systems can provide the means to understand and manipulate complex systems and components. In order to develop such systems, we need to shift our attention away from the detailed specification of algorithms, towards the description of the properties of the packages and objects with which we build. This paper analyzes some of the shortcomings of programming languages as they now exist, and lays out some possible directions for future research.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;In order to multiply matrices while minimizing the number of page fetches required, it is often more efficient to reorganize the data into submatrix form and to use block multiplication rather than to use the best known algorithms which leave the matrices stored in row-(or column-)oriented form. An efficient method for accomplishing this reorganization is given. This also makes possible the derivation of an asymptotically better bound for multiplication of matrices given in row-oriented form by adapting the technique of Strassen to the reorganized data. The reorganization\slash block multiplication scheme is shown to be advantageous for matrices and pages of realistic size; the Strassen adaptation is not. The former scheme is also shown to be advantageous even if the transpose of one of the matrices is available at no additional cost.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;The possibility of giving different quality of service to jobs of different classes by regulating their memory allocation is examined in the context of a paged computer system. Two parameterized algorithms which partition the main memory between two classes of jobs are considered. Initially, a closed system consisting of a processor and paging and file devices, with fixed number of jobs, is studied to determine optimal degrees of multiprogramming and the proportion of processor time devoted to each class. Applying a decomposition approach and treating the closed system as a single server, the response times in an open system with external arrivals are studied. The object is to investigate the effect of the memory allocation parameters on the expected response times under the two algorithms. Numerical solutions and economical lower bounds for the expected response times as functions of the control parameters are obtained. A way of applying the results to systems with more than two job classes is indicated.&quot;,

An $O(\log_2n)$ time bound also can be achieved using only $n n/\log_2n$ processors. The algorithm can be used to find the transitive closure of a symmetric Boolean matrix. We assume that the processors have access to a common memory. Simultaneous access to the same location is permitted for fetch instructions but not for store instructions.&quot;,

The co-authors of the report are: Gordon Bell, Digital Equipment Corporation; Bernard A. Galler, University of Michigan; Patricia Goldberg, IBM Corporation; John Hamblen, University of Missouri at Rolla; Elliot Pinson, Bell Telephone Laboratories; and Ivan Sutherland, California Institute of Technology. Also participating in the workshop were representatives of NSF and other government agencies. In addition to the authors, a number of other people have contributed to the contents of this report. In preparation for the original workshop, all doctorate-granting computer science departments in the nation were asked for comments and suggestions on the problems of experimental computer science. A version of the current report dated January 15 was circulated to these departments and to a number of industrial and government groups for criticism. The editors and authors of this final version gratefully acknowledge the contribution of a large number of other people at all stages in the preparation of the report. \par Note: Following this presentation of the report, there is a position paper on the crisis in experimental computer science written by the ACM Executive Committee.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;An algorithm for inserting an element into a one-sided height-balanced (OSHB) binary search tree is presented. The algorithm operates in time $O(\log n)$, where $n$ is the number of nodes in the tree. This represents an improvement over the best previous ly known insertion algorithms of Hirschberg and Kosaraju, which require time $O(\log 2n)$. Moreover, the $O(\log n)$ complexity is optimal. Earlier results have shown that deletion in such a structure can also be performed in $O(\log n)$ time. Thus the result of this paper gives a negative answer to the question of whether such trees should be the first examples of their kind, where deletion has a smaller time complexity than insertion. Furthermore, it can now be concluded that insertion, deletion, and retrieval in OSHB trees can be performed in the same time as the corresponding operations for the more general AVL trees, to within a constant factor. However, the insertion and deletion algorithms for OSHB trees appear much more complicated than the corresponding algorithms for AVL trees.&quot;,

Two of the algorithms are well-known in the statistical and computational literature; the other two are new algorithms specifically intended for automatic computation. Our discussion is expository, with emphasis on reaching a suitable definition of ``accuracy.'' Each of the four algorithms is analyzed for the conditions under which it will be accurate. We conclude that all four algorithms will provide accurate answers for many problems, but two of the algorithms, one new, one old, are substantially more accurate on difficult problems than are the other two.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;A new algorithm for global flow analysis on reducible graphs is presented. The algorithm is shown to treat a very general class of function spaces. For a graph of e edges, the algorithm has a worst-case time bound of 0(e log e) function operations. It is also shown that in programming terms, the number of operations is proportional to e plus the number of exits from program loops. Consequently a restriction to one-entry one-exit control structures guarantees linearity. The algorithm can be extended to yet larger classes of function spaces and graphs by relaxing the time bound. Examples are given of code improvement problems which can be solved using the algorithm.&quot;,

  abstract =     &quot;The problem of partitioning into classes by means of a binary equivalence relation is investigated. Several algorithms for determining the number of components in the graph associated with a particular set of elements are constructed and compared. When the classification process operates on independently-drawn samples of $n$ distinct elements from a population, the expected number of components is shown to be obtainable recursively for a class of problems called separable; in all cases, estimates are available to reach any desired level of accuracy. Clustering models in Euclidean space are analyzed in detail and asymptotic formulas obtained to complement experiments. Conjectures concerning the general behavior of the expected number of components are presented also. Finally, several computational tools of general interest are improved significantly.&quot;,
